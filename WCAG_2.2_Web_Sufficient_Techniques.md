## Techniques

### ARIA6: Using aria-label to provide labels for objects <a id="aria6"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide a label for objects that can be read by assistive technology. The `aria-label` attribute provides the text label for an object, such as a button. When a screen reader encounters the object, the `aria-label` text is read so that the user will know what it is.

      

Authors should be aware that `aria-label` may be disregarded by assistive technologies in situations where `aria-labelledby` is used for the same object. For more information on the naming hierarchy please consult the [accessible name and description computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/#mapping_additional_nd_te) section of the Accessible Name And Description Computation recommendation. Authors should be aware that use of `aria-label` will override any native naming such as `alt` on images or `label` associated with a form field using the `for` attribute.

#### Examples
##### Distinguishing navigation landmarks

         
            

The following example shows how `aria-label` could be used to distinguish two navigation landmarks in an HTML document, where there are more than two of the same type of landmark on the same page, and there is no existing text on the page that can be referenced as the label.

```html
<div role="navigation" aria-label="Primary">
  <ul>
    <li>...a list of links here ...</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div role="navigation" aria-label="Secondary">
  <ul>
    <li>...a list of links here ...</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

         
      

      

         

##### Identifying region landmarks

         
            

The following example shows how a generic "region" landmark might be added to a weather portlet. There is no existing text on the page that can be referenced as the label, so it is labelled with `aria-label`.

```html
<div role="region" aria-label="weather portlet"> 
  ...
</div>
```

         
      

      

         

##### Providing a label for Math

         
            

Below is an example of a MathML function, using the math role, appropriate label, and MathML rendering:

```html
<div role="math" aria-label="6 divided by 4 equals 1.5">
  <math xmlns="https://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mfrac>
      <mn>6</mn>
      <mn>4</mn>
    </mfrac>
      <mo>=</mo>
      <mn>1.5</mn>
  </math>
</div>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each element where a `aria-label` attribute is present.

         

1. Examine whether the text description accurately labels the object or provides a description of its purpose or provides equivalent information.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #1 is true.

### ARIA9: Using aria-labelledby to concatenate a label from several text nodes <a id="aria9"></a>

#### Description
The `aria-labelledby` property can be used to provide a name for all visual objects. Applied to inputs, the `aria-labelledby` property can be used to provide a name to native inputs as well as non-native elements, such as custom text inputs constructed with div contenteditable="true".

      

One particular use of `aria-labelledby` is for text inputs in situations where a meaningful name should consist of more than one text string.

      

Authors assign unique `id`s to the label strings to be concatenated as the name for the `input` element. The value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute is then a space-separated list of all `id`s in the order in which the label strings referenced should be read by screen readers. Supporting user agents will concatenate the label strings referenced and read them as one continuous name for the input.

      

The concatenation of strings can be useful for different reasons. In example 1, an input is nested within the context of a full sentence. The desired screen reader output is "Extend time-out to [ 20 ] minutes - edit with autocomplete, selected 20". Since the `id` of the text input is included in the string of `id`s referenced by aria-labelledby, the value of the input is included in the concatenated name at the right position.

      

Another application of `aria-labelledby` is when there is no space to provide a visible label next to the input, or when using native labels would create unnecessary redundancy. Here, the use `aria-labelledby` makes it possible to associate visible elements on the page as name for such inputs. This is demonstrated in example 2 where table column and row headings are concatenated into names for the text input elements inside the table.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> The [Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) specifies that the string specified in `aria-labelledby` should replace rather than add to the content of the element that carries the property. So adding the `aria-labelledby` property to a native label should replace the text content inside that label unless the label itself is referenced as part of the sequence of `id`s in `aria-labelledby`.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
##### A time-out input field with concatenated name

         
            

A text input allows users to extend the default time before a time-out occurs.

            

The string "Extend time-out to" is contained in a native `label` element and is associated with the input with the input by id="timeout-duration" . This label is associated with this input using the for/id association only on user agents that don't support ARIA. On user agents that support ARIA, the for/id association is ignored and the name for the input is provided only by `aria-labelledby`, per the [Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) in the HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0.

            

The `aria-labelledby` attribute on the text input references three elements: (1) the `span` containing the native label, (2) the text input containing the default text '20' (recall that this input is not labelled with the for/id associated label text), and (3) the string 'minutes' contained in a `span`. These elements should be concatenated to provide the full name for the text input

```html
<div>
  <span id="timeout-label">
    <label for="timeout-duration">Extend time-out to</label>
  </span>
  <input type="text" size="3" id="timeout-duration" value="20" 
   aria-labelledby="timeout-label timeout-duration timeout-unit">
  <span id="timeout-unit"> minutes</span>
</div>
```

##### A simple data table with text inputs

         
            

A simple data table containing text inputs. The input labels are concatenated through `aria-labelledby` referencing the respective column and row headers.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <th id="tpayer">Taxpayer</th>
    <th id="sp">Spouse</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="gross">W2 Gross</th>
    <td><input type="text" size="20" aria-labelledby="tpayer gross"></td>
    <td><input type="text" size="20" aria-labelledby="sp gross"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="divi">Dividends</th>
    <td><input type="text" size="20" aria-labelledby="tpayer divi"></td>
    <td><input type="text" size="20" aria-labelledby="sp divi"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### A conference workshop booking table

         
            

A conference workshop booking table with two parallel tracks allows users to select the workshop they want to attend. When tabbing through the checkbox inputs in the table, the track (1 or 2), the title, and the speaker of the workshop followed by the adjacent checkbox label "Attend" are provided as concatenated name for the checkboxes via `aria-labelledby`.

```html

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For inputs that use `aria-labelledby`:

         

1. Check that `id`s referenced in `aria-labelledby` are unique and match the `id`s of the text nodes that together provide the label
2. Check that the concatenated content of elements referenced by `aria-labelledby` is descriptive for the purpose or function of the element labeled

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #1 and #2 are true.

               

If this is a sufficient technique for a success criterion, failing this test procedure does not necessarily mean that the success criterion has not been satisfied in some other way, only that this technique has not been successfully implemented and can not be used to claim conformance.

### ARIA10: Using aria-labelledby to provide a text alternative for non-text content <a id="aria10"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide a short description for an element that can be read by assistive technologies by using the `aria-labelledby` attribute. The `aria-labelledby` attribute associates an element with text that is visible elsewhere on the page by using an `id` reference value that matches the `id` attribute of the labeling element. Assistive technology such as screen readers use the text of the element identified by the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute as the text alternative for the element with the attribute.

#### Examples
##### Providing a short description for a complex graphic

         
            

This example shows how to use the `aria-labelledby` attribute to provide a short text description for a read-only complex graphic of an star rating pattern; the graphic is composed of several image elements. The text alternative for the graphic is the label, visible on the page beneath the star pattern.

```html
<div role="img" aria-labelledby="star-id">
  <img src="fullstar.png" alt="">
  <img src="fullstar.png" alt="">
  <img src="fullstar.png" alt="">
  <img src="fullstar.png" alt="">
  <img src="emptystar.png" alt="">
</div>
<div id="star-id">4 of 5</div>
```

            

Working example: [Providing a short description for a complex graphic](../../working-examples/aria-labelledby-description-complex-graphic/).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Examine each element where the `aria-labelledby` attribute is present and the element does not support the `alt` attribute.
2. Check whether the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute is the `id` of an element on the web page.
3. Determine that the text of the element identified by the `aria-labelledby` attribute accurately labels the element, provides a description of its purpose, or provides equivalent information.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 and #3 are true.

### ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page <a id="aria11"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide programmatic access to sections of a web page.  Landmark roles (or "landmarks") programmatically identify sections of a page. Landmarks help assistive technology (AT) users orient themselves to a page and help them navigate easily to various sections of a page.

      

They also provide an easy way for users of assistive technology to skip over blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages and notify them of programmatic structure of a page. For instance, if there is a common navigation menu found on every page, landmark roles (or "landmarks") can be used to skip over it and navigate from section to section. This will save assistive technology users and keyboard users the trouble and time of tabbing through a large amount of content to find what they are really after, much like a traditional "skip links" mechanism. (Refer to User Agent Notes above for specifics of AT support). A blind user who may be familiar with a news site's menu, and is only interested in getting to the top story could easily navigate to the "main" landmark, and bypass dozens of menu links. In another circumstance, a user who is blind may want to quickly find a navigation menu, and can do so by jumping to the navigation landmark.

      

Landmarks also can help sighted keyboard-only users navigate to sections of a page using a [browser plugin](https://www.tpgi.com/improving-access-to-landmark-navigation/).

      

Landmarks are inserted into the page using the role attribute on an element that marks the section. The value of the attribute designates the type of landmark. These role values are listed below. For HTML mappings of landmark roles, refer to the Rules of ARIA attribute usage by HTML element table in the [ARIA In HTML recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/).

      

- `banner`: A region that contains mostly site-oriented content, rather than page-specific content.
- `navigation`: A region that contains a collection of navigational elements (usually links) for navigating the document or related documents.
- `main`: A region that contains the main content of a document.
- `region`: A region that contains a perceivable section of the page containing content that is relevant to a specific, author-specified purpose and sufficiently important that users will likely want to be able to navigate to the section easily. A `region` landmark isn't exposed as a landmark region unless it has an accessible name.
- `form`: A region that represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing. `form` isn't exposed as a landmark unless it has an accessible name.
- `search`: A region that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create search functionality.
- `complementary`: A region that supports the main content, yet is separate and meaningful on its own.
- `contentinfo`: A region that contains information about the parent document such as copyrights and links to privacy statements.

      

There are cases when a particular landmark role could be used more than once on a page, such as on primary and secondary blocks of navigation. In these cases, identical roles should be named using a valid technique for labeling regions.

      

Landmarks should supplement native semantic markup such as HTML headings, lists and other structural markup. Landmarks are interpretable by WAI-ARIA-aware assistive technologies and are not exposed by browsers directly to users.

      

It is a best practice to include all content on the page in landmarks, so that screen reader users who rely on them to navigate from section to section do not lose track of content.

#### Examples
##### Simple landmarks

         
      

The following example shows how landmarks might be added to an HTML document:

            
```html
<div role="banner">site logo and name, etc. here</div>
<div role="search">search functionality here</div>
<div role="navigation">a list of navigation links here</div>
<div role="form">a sign-up form here</div>
<div role="main">the page's main content here</div>
<div role="region">a sponsor's promotion here</div>
<div role="complementary">sidebar content here</div>
<div role="contentinfo"> site contact details, copyright information, etc. here </div>
```

   

##### Multiple landmarks of the same type and aria-labelledby

   

The following example shows a best practice of how landmarks might be added to an HTML document in situations where there are two or more of the same type of landmark on the same page. For instance, if a navigation role is used multiple times on a page, each instance may have a unique label specified using `aria-labelledby`:

```html
<div aria-labelledby="site-nav-heading" role="navigation">
  <h2 id="site-nav-heading">Site</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">nav link 1</a></li>  
      <li><a href="...">nav link 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">nav link 3</a></li>
   </ul>
</div>
<div aria-labelledby="related-nav-heading" role="navigation">
  <h2 id="related-nav-heading">Related Topics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">topic link 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">topic link 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">topic link 3</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

         
   

   

      

##### Multiple landmarks of the same type and aria-label

      
      

The following example shows a best practice of how landmarks might be added to an HTML document in situations where there are two or more of the same type of landmark on the same page, and there is no existing text on the page that can be referenced as the label:

```html
<div aria-label="Site" role="navigation">
   <ul>
      <li><a href="...">nav link 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">nav link 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">nav link 3</a></li>
   </ul>
</div>
<div aria-label="Tags" role="navigation">
   <ul>
      <li><a href="...">tag link 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">tag link 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">tag link 3</a></li>
   </ul>
</div>
```

   

   

      

##### Search form

      

The following example shows a search form with a "search" landmark. The `search` role typically goes on the `form` element or a `div` surrounding the form:

```html
<form role="search">
   <label for="product-search" id="search-label">Search</label>
   <input id="product-search" placeholder="title, author, or ISBN" type="text">
   <button type="submit">Find Books</button>
</form>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Examine each element with a [landmark role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#landmark_roles).
2. Examine whether the correct element has been used to mark up content. For example: a `navigation` role has been used to mark up a section with navigation links, or the `main` role is used to contain the page's main content.
3. If a landmark region needs to have an accessible name to be exposed as a landmark, check to see that there is an accessible name.
4. If the same type of landmark appears multiple times on the page, check that each one is given a unique and meaningful accessible name.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- #1, #2, #3, and #4 are true.

### ARIA12: Using role=heading to identify headings <a id="aria12"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide a way for Assistive Technologies (AT) to identify 
a piece of content as a heading. Applying `role="heading"` to an element causes an AT (like a screen reader) to treat it as though it were a heading. The `role="heading"` property must be paired with the `aria-level` property to define the heading level.

      

When possible, [use native heading markup](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1). For example, it is preferable to use an `h1` element, rather than using `<div role="heading" aria-level="1">`. Native HTML elements have implicit styling and features that won't necessarily be replicated with ARIA equivalents. For instance, heading elements will have specific styling adjustments made when viewing a page in a browser's Reader Mode. Whereas a `<div role="heading" aria-level="1">` will not be styled as a heading, because the underlying element is a `div`. ARIA only modifies the way an element is exposed to assistive technology, it does nothing to change the implicit style or functionality of the element it is applied to.

#### Examples
##### Simple headings

			

This example demonstrates how to implement headings using `role="heading"` and `aria-level`.

```html
<div role="heading" aria-level="2">Global News Items</div>
... a list of global news with editorial comment....
   
<div role="heading" aria-level="3">Politics</div>
... a list of global political news stories ...
```

      

      

         

##### Additional heading levels

         
            

This example demonstrates how to implement a level 7 heading using `role="heading"` and the `aria-level` attribute. Since HTML only supports headings up to level 6, there is no native element to provide these semantics.

```html
<h5>Fruit Trees</h5>
<h6>Apples</h6>
<p>Apples grow on trees in areas known as orchards...</p>
   ...
<div role="heading" aria-level="7">Jonagold</div>
<p>Jonagold is a cross between the Golden Delicious and Jonathan varieties...</p>
```

	
		

Headings with an `aria-level` of 10 or higher can create difficulties for users. At the time of writing (2024), most combinations of user agents and assistive technologies report such levels as being level 2.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

1. Examine each element with the attribute `role="heading"`.
2. Determine whether the content of the element is appropriate as a heading.
3. Determine whether the `aria-level` value is the appropriate hierarchical level.

    

    

			

##### Expected Results

			

- #2 and #3 are true.

### ARIA13: Using aria-labelledby to name regions and landmarks <a id="aria13"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide names for regions of a page that can be read by assistive technology.  The `aria-labelledby` attribute provides a way to associate a section of the page marked up as a region or landmarks with text that is on the page that labels it.

      

Landmark roles (or "landmarks") programmatically identify sections of a page. Landmarks help assistive technology (AT) users orient themselves to a page and help them navigate easily to various sections of a page.

      

Like `aria-describedby`, `aria-labelledby` can accept multiple `id`s to point to other regions of the page using a space separated list. It is also limited to `id`s for defining these sets.

#### Examples
##### Identify a landmark with on-page text

         
            

Below is an example of `aria-labelledby` used on a complementary Landmark. The region of the document to which the heading pertains could be marked with the `aria-labelledby` property containing the value of the `id` for the header.

```html
<div role="complementary" aria-labelledby="hdr1">
  <h1 id="hdr1">Top News Stories</h1>
  ...
</div>
```

         
      

      

         

##### Identification for Application landmarks

         
            

The following code snippet for application landmarks with static prose. If you have a regional landmark of type application and static descriptive text is available, then on the application landmark, include an aria-describedby reference to associate the application and the static text as shown here:

```html
<div role="application" aria-labelledby="p123" aria-describedby="info">
   <h1 id="p123">Calendar<h1>
   <p id="info">This calendar shows the game schedule for the Boston Red Sox.</p>
   <div role="grid">
    ...
   </div>
</div>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Examine each element with attribute role=region or with a [landmark role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#landmark_roles), where an aria-labelledby attribute is also present.
2. Check that the value of the aria-labelledby attribute is the id of an element on the page.
3. Check that the text of the element with that id accurately labels the section of the page.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 and #3 are true.

### ARIA14: Using aria-label to provide an accessible name where a visible label cannot be used <a id="aria14"></a>

#### Description
For sighted users, the context and visual appearance of an element can provide sufficient cues to determine the purpose. An example is the “×” often used in the top-right corner of dialogs to indicate the control for closing the dialog. While it might be visually clear that the button with the “×” symbol closes the dialog, users with assistive technologies rely on accessible names that clearly communicate the purpose of components, in this case “Close”.

      

When no clear visible text label is available due to design decisions, the [accessible name](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-name) can be set by using the `aria-label` attribute instead, provided that the element has an implicit or explicit [role that supports naming](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#namefromauthor).

The `aria-label` attribute can also be used to provide an accessible name for custom controls that are not [labelable elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#category-label), and cannot therefore use a `<label>` element with the `for` attribute.

For instance, `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` are the most suitable way to provide an accessible name when a `<div>` element is made editable using the `contentEditable` attribute, instead of native form elements such as `<input type="text">` or `<textarea>` in order to provide a richer text editing experience.

#### Examples
##### A close button in a dialog

        

On a page, a button displays a dialog (a `<div>` element) with additional information. The “close” element is implemented as a `<button>` containing merely the symbol “×”. The property `aria-label="close"` is used to provide an accessible name to the button.

        
```html
<dialog id="dialog">
  This is the content of the dialog.
  <button aria-label="Close">×</button>
</dialog>
```

        

Working example: [Close button example](../../working-examples/aria-label-accessible-name-dialog/).

      

      

        

##### A phone number with multiple fields

        
```html
<div role="group" aria-labelledby="groupLabel">
  <span id="groupLabel">Work Phone</span>
  +<input autocomplete="tel-country-code" type="number" aria-label="country code">
  <input autocomplete="tel-area-code" type="number" aria-label="area code">
  <input autocomplete="tel-local" type="number" aria-label="subscriber number">
</div>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

        

For elements that use the `aria-label` attribute:

        

1. Check that the value of the `aria-label` attribute properly describes the purpose of an element where user input is required

      

      

        

##### Expected Results

        

- #1 is true.

### ARIA15: Using aria-describedby to provide descriptions of images <a id="aria15"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide descriptions of images when a short text alternative does not adequately convey the function or information provided in the object.

      

A feature of WAI-ARIA is the ability to associate descriptive text with a section, drawing, form element, picture, and so on using the `aria-describedby` property. Descriptive text provided using `aria-describedby` is separate from the short name provided using the `alt` attribute in HTML. An advantage of providing long descriptions using content from the same page as the image is that the alternative is available to all, including sighted people who do not have assistive technology.

      

Like `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby` can accept multiple `id`s to point to other regions of the page using a space separated list. It is also limited to `id`s for defining these sets.

#### Examples
##### Describing an image

         
            

The following example shows how `aria-describedby` can be applied to an image to provide a long description, where that text description is on the same page as the image.

```html
<img src="ladymacbeth.jpg" alt="Lady MacBeth" aria-describedby="p1">
<p id="p1">This painting dates back to 1889 and is oil on canvas. It was created by 
 John Singer Sargent, and represents ...</p>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Examine each image element where a `aria-describedby` attribute is present.
2. Examine whether the `aria-describedby` attribute  programmatically associates an element with its text description, via the `id` attribute on the element where the text to be used as the description is found.
3. Examine whether the combined text equivalent and associated text description accurately describe or provide the equivalent purpose to the object.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #1, #2, and #3 are true.

### ARIA16: Using aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls <a id="aria16"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide names for user interface controls that can be read by assistive technology.  WAI-ARIA provides a way to associate text with a section, drawing, form element, picture, and so on, using the `aria-labelledby` property. This techniques uses the `aria-labelledby` attribute to associate a user interface control, such as a form field, with text on the page that labels it.

      

Like `aria-describedby`, `aria-labelledby` can accept multiple ids to point to other elements of the page using a space separated list. This capability makes `aria-labelledby` especially useful in situations where sighted users use information from the surrounding context to identify a control. [Using aria-labelledby to concatenate a label from several text nodes](ARIA9) contains more examples of situations where names are created from several other text elements on the page.

      

While the function of aria-labelledby appears similar to the native HTML label element, there are some differences:

      

- `aria-labelledby` can reference more than one text element; `label` can only reference one.
- `aria-labelledby` can be used for a variety of elements while the `label` element can only be used on form elements.
- Clicking on a `label` focuses the associated form field. This does not occur with `aria-labelledby`. If this behavior is required then use `label` or implement this functionality using scripting.

#### Examples
##### Labelling a simple text field

         
            

The following is an example of `aria-labelledby` used on a simple text field to provide a label in a situation where there is no text available for a dedicated label but there is other text on the page that can be used to accurately label the control.

```html
<input name="searchtxt" type="text" aria-labelledby="searchbtn">
<input name="searchbtn" id="searchbtn" type="submit" value="Search">
```

         
      

      

         

##### Labelling a slider

         
            

Below is an example of `aria-labelledby` used to provide a label for a slider control. In this case the label text is selected from within a longer adjacent text string. Please note that this example is simplified to show only the labeling relationship; authors implementing custom controls also need to ensure that controls meet other success criteria.

```html
<p>Please select the <span id="mysldr-lbl">number of days for your trip</span></p>
<div id="mysldr" role="slider" aria-labelledby="mysldr-lbl"></div>
```

         
      

      

         

##### A label from multiple sources

         
            

The following example of `aria-labelledby` with multiple references uses the `label` element. For additional detail on concatenating multiple sources of information into a label with `aria-labelledby`, please view the technique [Using ARIA labelledby to concatenate a label from several text nodes](ARIA9).

```html
<label id="l1" for="f3">Notify me</label>
<select name="amt" id="f3" aria-labelledby="l1 f3 l2">
  <option value="1">1</option>
  <option value="2">2</option>
</select>
<span id="l2">days in advance</span>
```

            

Note: The use of the `label` element is included for a number of reasons. If the user clicks on the text of the `label` element, the corresponding form field will receive focus, which makes the clicking target larger for people with dexterity problems. Also the `label` element will always be exposed via the accessibility API. A `span` could have been used. However, a `span` would lose the advantage of the larger clickable region.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each user interface control element where an `aria-labelledby` attribute is present:

         

1. Check that the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute is the `id` of an element or a space separated list of `id`s on the web page.
2. Check that the text of the referenced element or elements accurately labels the user interface control.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #1 and #2 are true.

### ARIA17: Using grouping roles to identify related form controls <a id="aria17"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to mark up a set of related controls within a form  as a group. Any label associated with the group also serves as a common label or qualifier for individual controls in the group. Assistive technologies can indicate the start and end of the group and the group's label as one navigates into and out of the group. This is a viable alternative for grouping form controls programmatically when the user interface's design makes it difficult to employ the `fieldset` / `legend` technique ([H71](../html/H71)).

      

For a group of radio buttons, one should use `role="radiogroup"` instead of `role="group"`.

      

The group can be labeled using `aria-labelledby`.

      

This technique is not meant for wrapping  all controls on a form within a single container with `role="group"`.

#### Examples
##### Social Security Number

         

Social security number fields which are nine digits long and broken up into three segments can be grouped using `role="group"`.

```html
<div role="group" aria-labelledby="ssn1">
  <span id="ssn1">Social Security Number</span> 
  <span style="color: #D90D0D;"> (required)</span>
  <input size="3" type="text" aria-required="true" title="First 3 digits">-
  <input size="2" type="text" aria-required="true" title="Next 2 digits">-
  <input size="4" type="text" aria-required="true" title="Last 4 digits">
</div>
```

            

Working example: [Multiple part field groups](../../working-examples/aria-grouping-multipart-fields-ssn/).

         
      

      

         

##### Identifying radio groups

         
            

This example demonstrates use `role=radiogroup`. Note also that the radio buttons are custom controls with `role=radio`. One may optionally employ CSS to place a border around groups of such fields to visually reinforce the group relationship. The CSS properties are available below the form.

```html
<h3>Set Alerts for your Account</h3>
<div role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="alert1">
  <p id="alert1">Send an alert when balance exceeds $3,000</p>
  <div>
    <span role="radio" aria-checked="false" aria-labelledby="a1r1" name="a1radio"></span>
    <span id="a1r1">Yes</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span role="radio" aria-checked="false" aria-labelledby="a1r2" name="a1radio"></span>
    <span id="a1r2">No</span>
  </div>
</div>
<div role="radiogroup" aria-checked="false" aria-labelledby="alert2">
  <p id="alert2">Send an alert when a charge exceeds $250</p>
  <div>
    <span role="radio" aria-checked="false" aria-labelledby="a2r1" name="a2radio"></span>
    <span id="a2r1">Yes</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span role="radio" aria-checked="false" aria-labelledby="a2r2" name="a2radio"></span>
    <span id="a2r2">No</span>
   </div>
</div>
<input type="submit" value="Continue" name="continue_btn">
```

Related CSS Style Definition to place a border around the group of fields:

```css
div[role=radiogroup] {
  border: black thin solid;
}
```

> **Note:**
> >                The script to make the `span` actually work like radio buttons is not included in this example. For a similar, but coded slightly differently, working example, see the the ARIA Authoring Practices' [Radio Group Example Using aria-activedescendant](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/examples/radio-activedescendant/) example.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For groups of related controls where the individual labels for each control do not provide a sufficient description, and an additional group level description is needed:

         

1. Check that the group of logically related input or select elements are contained within an element with `role=group`, or `role=radiogroup` depending on the type of elements the group contains.
2. Check that this group has an accessible name defined using `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- #1 and #2 are true.

### ARIA18: Using aria-alertdialog to Identify Errors <a id="aria18"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to alert people that an input error has occurred. Using `role="alertdialog"` creates a notification. This notification should be modal with the following characteristics:

      

- `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute gives the alertdialog an accessible name.
- The `alertdialog` contains at least one focusable element, and the focus should move to that element when the `alertdialog` opens.
- The tab order is constrained within the `alertdialog` whilst it is open.
- When the `alertdialog` is dismissed, the focus moves back to the position it had before the `alertdialog` opened, if possible.

      

Note that the `alertdialog` should not be present in a way that it will be accessed by assistive technology until it is needed. One way to do this is not to include it in the static HTML and instead to insert it into the DOM via script when the error condition is triggered. The insertion would correspond to the following HTML sample.

#### Examples
##### Alert dialog

         
            

This example shows how a notification using `role="alertdialog"` can be used to notify someone they have entered invalid information.

```html
<div role="alertdialog" aria-labelledby="alertHeading">
  <h1 id="alertHeading">Error</h1>
  <p>Employee's Birth Date is after their hire date.
   Please verify the birth date and hire date.</p>
  <button>Save and Continue</button>
  <button>Return to page and correct error</button>
</div>
```

            

Working example: [Alert dialog](../../working-examples/aria-alertdialog-identify-errors/).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Trigger the error that causes the `alertdialog` to appear.
2. Determine that the `alertdialog` contains at least one focusable element, and the focus moves to that element when the `alertdialog` opens.
3. Determine that the tab order is constrained within the `alertdialog` while it is open, and when the `alertdialog` is dismissed, the focus moves back to the position it had before the `alertdialog` opened, if possible.
4. Examine the element with `alertdialog` applied.
5. Determine that either the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute has been correctly used to give the alertdialog an accessible name.
6. Determine that the contents of the `alertdialog` identifies the input error.
7. Determine whether contents of the `alertdialog` suggests how to fix the error.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #2, #3, #5 and #6 are true. For Success Criterion 3.3.3, check #7 is also true.

### ARIA19: Using ARIA role=alert or Live Regions to Identify Errors <a id="aria19"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to notify Assistive Technologies (AT) when an input error occurs. The `aria-live` attribute makes it possible for an AT (such as a screen reader) to be notified when error messages are injected into a Live Region container. The content within the `aria-live` region is automatically read by the AT, without the AT having to focus on the place where the text is displayed.

      

There are also a number of [special case live region roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#live_region_roles) which can be used instead of applying live region properties directly.

#### Examples
##### Injecting error messages into a container with role=alert already present in the DOM

         
            

The following example uses role=alert which is equivalent to using aria-live=assertive.

            

In the example there is an empty error message container element with aria-atomic=true and an aria-live property or alert role present in the DOM on page load. The error container must be present in the DOM on page load for the error message to be spoken by most screen readers. aria-atomic=true is necessary to make Voiceover on iOS read the error messages after more than one invalid submission.

            

jQuery is used to test if the inputs are empty on submit and inject error messages into the live region containers if so. Each time a new submit is attempted the previous error messages are removed from the container and new error messages injected.

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(e) {
  $('#signup').submit(function() {
    $('#errors').html('');
    if ($('#first').val() === '') {
      $('#errors').append('<p>Please enter your first name.</p>');
    }
    if ($('#last').val() === '') {
      $('#errors').append('<p>Please enter your last name.</p>');
    } 
    if ($('#email').val() === '') {
      $('#errors').append('<p>Please enter your email address.</p>');
    }
    return false;
  });
});
```

```html
<form name="signup" id="signup">
  <p id="errors" role="alert" aria-atomic="true"></p>
  <div>
    <label for="first">First Name (required)</label><br>
    <input type="text" name="first" id="first">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="last">Last Name (required)</label><br>
    <input type="text" name="last" id="last">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="email">Email (required)</label><br>
    <input type="text" name="email" id="email">
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" name="button" id="button" value="Submit">
  </div>
 </form>
```

            

Working example: [Using role=alert to identify errors](../../working-examples/aria-alert-identify-errors/).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Determine that an empty error container with `role=alert` or `aria-live=assertive` attribute is present in the DOM at page load.
2. Trigger the error that causes the content in the live region to appear or update.
3. Determine that the error message was injected into the already present error container.

      

      

				

##### Expected Results

        

- #1 and #3 are true.

### ARIA20: Using the region role to identify a region of the page <a id="aria20"></a>

#### Description
This technique demonstrates how to assign a generic `region` role to a section of a page so that user agents and assistive technologies may be able to programmatically identify it. The `region` role demarcates a segment of the page that contains content of significance so that it is more readily discoverable and navigable. The generic region should be used when the section cannot be marked up using a standard document landmark role (see [ARIA11](ARIA11)).

It is important to name regions, because they are generic grouping elements and users will need some way to tell which region they are in. Regions can be named using `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, or another technique. Doing so helps to better expose content and information relationships on the page. The role of `region` should be used prudently, because if overused they can make the page overly verbose for screen reader users.

#### Examples
##### Region on a news website

         
            

A section on the home page of a news website that contains a poll that changes every week is marked up with `role="region"`. The `h3` above the form is referenced as the region's name using `aria-labelledby`.

```html
<div role="region" aria-labelledby="pollhead">
  <h3 id="pollhead">This week's Poll</h3>
  <form>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Do you believe the tax code needs to be overhauled?</legend>
      <input type="radio" id="r1" name="poll">
      <label for="r1">No, it's fine the way it is</label>
      <input type="radio" id="r2" name="poll">
      <label for="r2">Yes, the wealthy need to pay more</label>
      <input type="radio" id="r3" name="poll">
      <label for="r3">Yes, we need to close corporate loopholes</label>
      <input type="radio" id="r4" name="poll">
      <label for="r4">Changes should be made across the board</label>
    </fieldset>
  </form>
  <a href="results.php">See Poll Results</a>
</div>
```

            
         
      

      

         

##### Identifying a region on a banking site

         
            

A user can expand links on a bank website after logging in to see details of term deposit accounts. The details are within a `span` marked up with `region` role. The heading for the region has `role=heading` and is included in the `aria-labelledby` that names the region.

```html
<ol>
  <li>
    <button aria-controls="block1" aria-expanded="false" id="l1" title="show details"
      type="button">John Henry's Account <img alt="" src="images/panel_expand.gif">
    </button>
    <div id="block1" class="nowHidden" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="l1 cd1"
      role="region">
      <span id="cd1" role="heading" aria-level="3">Certificate Of Deposit</span>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Account:</th>
          <td>25163522</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
          <th scope="row">Start date:</th>
          <td>February 1, 2014</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
          <th scope="row">Maturity date:</th>
          <td>February 1, 2016</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
          <th scope="row">Deposit Amount:</th>
          <td>$ 3,000.00</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
          <th scope="row">Maturity Amount:</th>
          <td>$ 3,072.43</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>
```

            
         
      

      

         

##### Identifying a portlet with a generic region

         
            

This example shows how a generic `region` landmark might be added to a weather portlet. There is no existing text on the page that can be referenced as the label, so it is labelled with `aria-label`.

         

```html
<div role="region" aria-label="weather portlet"> 
  ...
</div>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each section marked up with `role="region"`:

         

1. Examine the content and ensure that it is important enough to have an independent landmark
2. Ensure that a standard landmark role is not appropriate for this content
3. Check that the region has a programmatically determined name

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1-3 are true.

### ARIA21: Using aria-invalid to Indicate An Error Field <a id="aria21"></a>

#### Description
This technique demonstrates how `aria-invalid` may be employed to specifically identify fields that have failed validation. Its use is most suitable when:

   
 

- The error description does not programmatically identify the failed fields
- The failed fields are identified in a manner that is not available to some users - for example by using an error-icon rendered visually by some technique that does not rely on color such as a visual cue like a border.

> **Note:**
> > 
> One of the above two situations may be true for a field which has programmatically associated label and / or instructions that conveys data format, a data range, or the `required` property.
> 
>

   

While it is always preferable to programmatically associate specific error description with the failed field, the page's design or the framework employed may sometimes constrain the author's ability to do so. In these cases, authors may programmatically set `aria-invalid` to `"true"` on the fields that have failed validation. This is interpretable mainly by assistive technologies (like screen readers / screen magnifiers) employed by users who are vision impaired. When a field has `aria-invalid` set to “true”, VoiceOver in Safari announces invalid data when the field gets focus; JAWS and NVDA notify the error as an invalid entry.

This ARIA attribute has to be set / turned on programmatically. It should not be set to “true” before input validation is performed or the form is submitted. Setting `aria-invalid` to `"false"` is the same as not placing the attribute for the form control at all. Quite understandably, nothing is conveyed by assistive technology to users in this case.

When visible text is used to programmatically identify a failed field and / or convey how the error can be corrected, setting `aria-invalid` to `"true"` is not required from a strict compliance standpoint but may still provide helpful information for users.

#### Examples
##### Using aria-invalid on required fields

         
            

The `aria-invalid` attribute is used on required fields that have no input. A message above the form conveys that form submission has failed due to this.

			

A portion of the jQuery code and the HTML form markup follow:

```html
<script>
...
...
   if ($('#first').val() === '') {
      $('#first').attr("aria-invalid", "true");

##### Identifying errors in data format

         
            

`aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` are used together to indicate an error when the personal identification number (PIN), email address, or start date are not in the expected format. The error message is associated with the field using `aria-describedby`, and `aria-invalid` makes it easier to programmatically find fields with errors.

            

Below is the rendered HTML code for the email address field in Example 1: When an invalid email address is entered by the user such as "samexample.com" (instead of sam@example.com), the HTML code is:

```html
<div class="control">
  <div>
    <label for="email">Email address: [*]</label> 
    <input type="email" name="email" id="email" class="error"
     aria-invalid="true" aria-describedBy="err_1">
  </div>
  <span class="errtext" id="err_1">Error: Incorrect data</span>
</div>
```

And when no data is entered in the email field, the HTML code is:

```html
<div class="control">
  <div><label for="email">Email address: [*]</label> 
    <input type="email" name="email" id="email" class="error"
     aria-invalid="true" aria-describedBy="err_2">
  </div>
  <span class="errtext" id="err_2">Error: Input data missing</span>
</div>
```

jQuery code: jQuery is used to add aria-invalid or aria-describedby attributes as well as the class attribute and append the error text. This is the code that inserts aria-invalid and class="error" but does not associate the error text "incorrect data" with the control programmatically:

```javascript
$(errFld).attr("aria-invalid", "true").attr("class", "error");
// Suffix error text: 
$(errFld).parent().append('<span class="errtext">Error: Incorrect data</span>');
```

CSS Code:

```css
input.error {
  border: red thin solid;
}

span.errtext {
  background-color: #EEEEFF;
  background-image:url('images/iconError.gif');
  background-position:right;	
  background-repeat:no-repeat;
  border: red thin solid;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
  padding: .25em 1.4em .25em .25em;
}
```

      	

[Working example: Identifying errors in data format](../../working-examples/aria-invalid-data-format/).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each form control that relies on `aria-invalid` to convey a validation failure:

         

1. Check that `aria-invalid` is not set to true when a validation failure does not exist.
2. Check that `aria-invalid` is set to true when a validation failure does exist.
3. Check that the programmatically associated labels / programmatically associated instructional text for the field provide enough information to understand the error.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1-3 are true.

### ARIA22: Using role=status to present status messages <a id="aria22"></a>

#### Description
This technique uses the `status` role from the ARIA specification to notify Assistive Technologies (AT) when content has been updated with information about the user's or application's status. This is done by adding `role="status"` to the element that contains the [status message](). The aria live region role of `status` has an implicit `aria-live` value of `polite`, which allows a user to be notified via AT (such as a screen reader) when status messages are added. The role of `status` also has a default `aria-atomic` value of `true`, so that updates to the container marked with a role of `status` will result in the AT presenting the entire contents of the container to the user, including any author-defined labels (or additional nested elements). Such additional context can be critical where the status message text alone will not provide an equivalent to the visual experience. The content of the aria-live container is automatically read by the AT, without the AT having to focus on the place where the text is displayed. See [WAI-ARIA status (role)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#status) for more details.

Note that since `role="status"` is currently not treated as atomic by default in some environments, it is advisable to add an explicit `aria-atomic="true"` if the entire contents of the container should be announced.

#### Examples
##### Including a search results message

				

After a user presses a Search button, the page content is updated to include the results of the search, which are displayed in a section below the Search button. The change to content also includes the message "5 results returned" near the top of this new content. This text is given an appropriate role for a status message. A screen reader will announce "5 results returned".

```html
<div role="status" aria-atomic="true">5 results returned.</div>
```

				

[Working example: role=status on search results](../../working-examples/aria-role-status-searchresults/)

			

			

				

##### Updating the shopping cart status

				

After a user presses an Add to Shopping Cart button, content near the Shopping Cart icon updates to read "1 items". The container for this text (in this case a `<p>`) is marked with `role="status"`. Because it adds visual context, the shopping cart image — with succinct and accurate `alt` text — is also placed in the container. Due to the `aria-atomic` value, a screen reader will announce "Shopping cart, six items".

```html
<p role="status" aria-atomic="true">
  <img src="shopping-cart.png" alt="Shopping Cart">
  <span id="cart">0</span> items
</p>

```

				

[Working example: role=status on a shopping cart](../../working-examples/aria-role-status-shoppingcart/)

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For each [status message]():

				

1. Check that the container destined to hold the status message has a `role` attribute with a value of `status` *before* the status message occurs.
2. Check that when the status message is triggered, it is inside the container.
3. Check that elements or attributes that provide information equivalent to the visual experience for the status message (such as a shopping cart image with proper `alt` text) also reside in the container.

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- #1, #2 and #3 are true.

### ARIA23: Using role=log to identify sequential information updates <a id="aria23"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to notify Assistive Technologies (AT) when content has been appended to sequential information concerning the application's history or logs. The aria live region role of `log` has an implicit `aria-live` value of `polite` and `aria-atomic` value of `false`, which allows a user to be notified via AT (such as a screen reader) when log messages are added. The new content within the aria-live region is automatically read by the AT, without the AT having to focus on the place where the text is displayed. See [WAI-ARIA 1.1 log (role)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#log) for more details.

#### Examples
##### Updating the contents of a chat conversation

				

					

Comments that users type into a chat input field are appended to the end of the chat history region. The region is marked with `role="log"` so that new additions are announced by ATs. When each new chat message appears, a screen reader should announce its content (depending on AT/browser compatibility).

				

```html
<div id="chatRegion" role="log" aria-labelledby="chatHeading">
  <h4 id="chatHeading">Chat History</h4>
  <ul id="conversation">
    <li>The latest chat message</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

				

[Working example: using `role="log"` with chat conversation](../../working-examples/aria-role-log/chatlog.html)

			

			

				

##### Updating the log of a server

				

An application log records time-stamped activities. The log is exposed in the app as a view, with the region marked with `role="log"` so that the new additions are announced by the ATs. (The default value for the `aria-relevant` attribute is `"additions"`, so the removal of the old top entries due to log size limitations will not be announced.)  When each new log entry is added, a screen reader announces it.

```html
<div id="activityLog" role="log">
  <h4 id="logHeading">Recent activity</h4>
  <ul id="logentries"">
    <li>08:03 UserX logged off</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

				

[Working example: using `role="log"` with server log](../../working-examples/aria-role-log/serverlog.html)

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

On a page that contains sequentially updating information:

				

1. Check that the container for the information is given a role of `log`.

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- #1 is true.

### ARIA24: Semantically identifying a font icon with role="img" <a id="aria24"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to show how to semantically identify an element that uses a font file for icons. When a user overrides font-family these icons typically disappear unless there is a means to identify them. The point is to provide a technique to differentiate icon fonts from general font (text) usage.

         

Some low vision users need user stylesheets, scripts, or extensions to override the fonts on a page to perceive text content. However, they need to be able to perceive icon fonts that are meaningful, such as a star signifying a favorite, or an email icon in a link.

         

The key is for the author to semantically markup icon fonts with `role="img"`. Then the user's font replacement selector can hook into that semantic and exclude `role="img"`. This results in those icon fonts being shown.

         

##### Basic principle of the technique

         

###### 1. Author adds a font-face to the CSS

         

The first step is used for adding a font face with icons via the CSS file.

         
```css
/* specify font-family name for icons */
@font-face { font-family: 'IconFontRoleImg'; }

/* default class for fonts-face with icons */
.icon,
[class^="icon-"],
[class*=" icon-"] { font-family: 'IconFontRoleImg' !important; }

/* specific class for icon */
.icon-star-bg:before { content: "\e982"; }
```

         

###### 2. Author adds the font classes to the HTML

         

The second step adds classes, the role="img" attribute for semantics and an accessible name.

         
```html
<!-- icon via class names, role="img" and a text alternative -->
<p>
  <span class="icon icon-star-bg" role="img" aria-label="Favorite"></span>
</p>
```

         

###### 3. User CSS file replaces the font-family except the icon file

         

The third step uses the ":not selector" in combination with the "[attribute] selector" to only replace font faces for regular text.

         
```css
/* replaces font faces but excludes all elements with attribute role="img" */
*:not([role="img"]) { font-family: Verdana, sans-serif !important; }
```

#### Examples
##### Star Icon Font used as an indicator (not interactive)

            

In this example a star icon is used to indicate a favorite. It is not interactive and does not disappear if the user overrides the font family via CSS.

			

            

###### Author CSS

            
```css
/* default class for fonts-face with icons */
.icon { font-family: 'IconFontRoleImg' !important; }

/* specific class for icon */
.icon-star-bg:before { content: "\e982"; }
```

			

         	

            

###### HTML

			

            

###### - Instead of... -

##### Two colored / stacked star Icon Font used as an indicator

            

In this example a two colored star icon is created by stacking two fonts with different colors on top of each other. This way it's possible to mimic only half the star is filled. It is not interactive and does not disappear if the user overrides the font family via CSS.

			

            

###### Author CSS

            
```css
/* default class for fonts-face with icons */
.icon { font-family: 'IconFontRoleImg' !important; }

/* specific classes for icons */
.icon-star-bg:before    {content: "\e982"; }
.icon-star-half:before  {content: "\e983"; }

##### Email Icon Font in a link WITHOUT visible text

            

In this example an email icon is in a link with no visible text. It does not disappear if a user overrides font family. The icon font is identified by assistive technology as a "link image" and the name "Email" (keyboard or mouse).

			

            

###### Author CSS

            
```css
/* default class for fonts-face with icons */
.icon { font-family: 'IconFontRoleImg' !important; }

##### Multiple Icon Fonts as part of another sematic element WITH visible text

            

This example already has a visible text label in the link to be used as an accessible name, the mail and chevron font icons must stay visible when the font family is changed. This can be done by ensuring the icons are contained in their own element and the attribute `aria-hidden="true"` is used so the font icons will be ignored by assistive technologies.

			

            

###### Author CSS

            
```css
/* default class for fonts-face with icons */
.icon { font-family: 'IconFontRoleImg' !important; }

/* specific class for icon */

### C9: Using CSS to include decorative images <a id="c9"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism to add purely decorative images and images used for visual formatting to web content without requiring additional markup within the content. This makes it possible for assistive technologies to ignore the non-text content. Some user agents can ignore or turn off CSS at the user's request, so that background images included with CSS simply "disappear" and do not interfere with display settings such as enlarged fonts or high contrast settings.

		

Background images can be included with the following CSS properties:

      

- `background`;
- `background-image`;
- `content`, combined with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements;
- `list-style-image`.

      

> **Note:**
> >         
> 
> This technique is not appropriate for any image that conveys information or provides functionality, or for any image primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
##### Background image for an HTML page

      

The stylesheet for a web page specifies a background image for the whole page.

         

```html
<style>
  body { background: #ffe url('/images/home-bg.jpg') repeat; }
</style>
```

      

      

         

##### Background image with CSS for image rollovers

         

The stylesheet for a web page uses the CSS background property to create a decorative rollover effects when a user hovers their mouse pointer over a link.

         

```css
a:hover {
  background: #ffe url('/images/hover.gif') repeat;
  color: #000;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

1. Check for the presence of decorative images
2. Check that they are included with CSS

		

		

			

##### Expected Results

			

- If #1 is true, then #2 is true.

### C15: Using CSS to change the presentation of a user interface component when it receives focus <a id="c15"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how visual appearance may be enhanced via style sheets to provide visual feedback when an interactive element has focus or when a user hovers over it using a pointing device. Highlighting the element that has focus or is hovered over can provide information such as the fact that the element is interactive or the scope of the interactive element.

      

Providing visual feedback may be possible through more than one mode. Usually, it is attained through using a mouse to hover over the element or a keyboard to tab to the element.

#### Examples
##### Link elements

			

In this example, mouse and keyboard focus indicators have been applied to the link elements. CSS has been used to apply a background color when the link elements receive focus.

			

Here is the content to be displayed:

         

```html
<nav id="main-nav">
  <ul>
    <li>Home</li>
    <li><a href="/services">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/projects">Projects</a></li>
    <li><a href="/demos">Demos</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about-us">About us</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact-us">Contact us</a></li>
    <li><a href="/links">Links</a></li>
  </ul>
<nav>
```

			

Here is the CSS that changes the background color for the above elements when they receive mouse or keyboard focus:

   

```css
#main-nav a:hover, #main-nav a:active, #main-nav a:focus-visible {
  background-color: #DCFFFF;
  color:#000066;
}
```

      

      

				

##### Highlighting elements that receive focus

				

In this example, the :focus pseudo-class is used to change the style applied to input fields when they receive focus by changing the background color.

         

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <style>
      input[type=text]:focus-visible {
        outline:2px solid #0054AE;
        outline-offset:2px;
      }

      input[type=checkbox]:focus + label, input[type=radio]:focus + label {
        background-color:#1E2EB8; 
        color:#FFF;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="fname">Name: </label>
        <input autocomplete="name" type="text" name="fname" id="fname">
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="radio" name="sex" value="male" id="sm">
        <label for="sm">Male</label>
      </div>
      <div>			
        <input type="radio" name="sex" value="female" id="sf">
        <label for="sf">Female</label>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

         
            

Working example of this code: [Example of highlighting elements that receive focus](../../working-examples/focus-pseudo-class/).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each element able to attain focus:

         

1. Using a keyboard, tab to the component.
2. Check that the focus indicator changes color.
3. Check that the focus indicator is removed when the component loses focus.

      

      

				

##### Expected Results

				

- Checks #2 and #3 true.

The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how CSS can be used to control the visual presentation of text. This will allow users to modify, via the user agent, the visual characteristics of the text to meet their requirement. The text characteristics include aspects such as size, color, font family and relative placement.

      

CSS benefits accessibility primarily by separating document structure from presentation. Style sheets were designed to allow precise control - outside of markup - of character spacing, text alignment, object position on the page, audio and speech output, font characteristics, etc. By separating style from markup, authors can simplify and clean up the markup in their content, making it more accessible at the same time.

      

Text within images has several accessibility problems, including the inability to:

      

- be scaled according to settings in the browser
- be displayed in colors specified by settings in the browser or rules in user-defined style sheets
- honor operating system settings, such as high contrast

      

It is better to use real text for the text portion of these elements, and a combination of semantic markup and style sheets to create the appropriate visual presentation. For this to work effectively, choose fonts that are likely to be available on the user's system and define fallback fonts for users who may not have the first font that is specified. Newer machines and user agents often smooth or anti-alias all text, so it is likely that your headings and buttons will look nice on these systems without resorting to images of text.

      

The following CSS properties are useful to style text and avoid the need for text in images:

      

- The `font-family` property is used to display the code aspect in a monospace font family.
- The `text-align` property is used to display the text to the right of the viewport.
- The `font-size` property is used to display the text in a larger size.
- The `font-style` property is used to display text in italics.
- The `font-weight` property is used to set how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed.
- The `color` property is used to display the color of text or text containers.
- The `line-height` property is used to display the line height for a block of text.
- The `text-transform` property is used to control the case of letters in text.
- The `letter-spacing` property is used to control the spacing of letters in text.
- The `background-image` property can be used to display text on a non-text background.
- The `::first-line` pseudo-element can be used to modify the presentation of the first line in a block of text.
- The `::first-letter` pseudo-element can be used to modify the presentation of the first letter in a block of text.
- The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements can be used to insert decorative non-text content before or after blocks of text.

### C27: Making the DOM order match the visual order <a id="c27"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that the order of content in the source code is the same as the visual presentation of the content. The order of content in the source code can be changed by the author to any number of visual presentations with CSS. Each order may be meaningful in itself but may cause confusion for assistive technology users. This could be due to the user switching off the author-specified presentation, by accessing the content directly from the source code (such as with a screen reader), or by interacting with the content with a keyboard. If a blind user, who reads the page with a screen reader that follows the source order, is working with a sighted user who reads the page in visual order, they may be confused when they encounter information in different orders. A user with low vision who uses a screen magnifier in combination with a screen reader may be confused when the reading order appears to skip around on the screen. A keyboard user may have trouble predicting where focus will go next when the source order does not match the visual order.

		

There may also be situations where the visually presented order is necessary to the overall understanding of the page, and if the source order is presented differently, it may be much more difficult to understand.

		

When the source order matches the visual order, everyone will read the content and interact with it in the same (correct) order.

		

> **Note:**
> > 			
> 
> The `tabindex` attribute in HTML has two functions. One is to make an element focusable and the other is to assign the element a position in the focus order. A `tabindex` of `0` makes an element focusable, but adds it to the focus order in the order of source elements. The focus order will follow positive values of tabindex in ascending order. Setting `tabindex` values that result in an order different from the order of elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) can mean the order is incorrect for users of assistive technologies. This is largely because the tabindex property is specified in the HTML and not the CSS. This may change in future specifications. It may also differ from the visual presentation order.

#### Examples
- An online newspaper has placed a navigation bar visually in the top left corner of the page directly below its initial logo. In the source code, the navigation elements appear after the elements encoding the logo.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

1. Visually examine the order of the content in the web page as it is presented to the end user.
2. Examine the elements in the DOM using a tool that allows you to see the DOM.
3. Ensure that the order of the content in the source code sections match the visual presentation of the content in the web page. (e.g., for an English language page the order is from top to bottom and from left to right.) "

		

		

			

##### Expected Results

			

- Step #3 is true.

### C30: Using CSS to replace text with images of text and providing user interface controls to switch <a id="c30"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how CSS can be used to replace structured HTML text with images of text in a way that makes it possible for users to view content according to their preferences. To use this technique, an author starts by creating an HTML page that uses semantic elements to mark up the structure of the page. The author then designs two or more stylesheets for that page. One stylesheet presents the HTML text as text and the second uses CSS features to replace some of the HTML text with images of text. Finally, through the use of server-side or client-side scripting, the author provides a control that allows the user to switch between the available views.

      

This technique can be used to meet Success Criterion 1.4.5 or 1.4.9 if a presentation that does not include images of text is available and as long as the user interface control that is provided to allow users to switch to an alternate presentation meets the relevant criteria. Where possible, authors should deliver the presentation that does not include images of text as the default presentation. In addition, the control used to switch should be located near the beginning of the page.

      

A variety of "image replacement" techniques have been developed to address a variety of user agent, configuration and compatibility with assistive technology issues (See resources for more information). While there are a variety of approaches authors may use to replace text, it is important to consider compatibility with assistive technology, whether the technique will work correctly if scripting, CSS, images (or combinations of these) are turned off. Since it can be difficult to find a single solution that works in all cases, this technique recommends the use of a control that allows users to switch to a presentation that does not include an image replacement technique.

      

> **Note:**
> > 				
> 
> This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a [conforming alternate version]() for non-conforming content. Refer to [C29](C29) and [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](../../Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions) for more information.

#### Examples
##### Replacing heading text with images of text

				

A design studio site uses a style switcher to allow users to view two presentations of their home page. For the default version, the heading text is replaced with images of text. A control on the page allows users to switch to a version that presents the headings as text.

				

					

###### The HTML component

```html
<div id="Header"> 
  <h1><span>Pufferfish Design Studio</span></h1> 
  <h2><span>Surprising Identity and Design Solutions</span></h2> 
</div>
```

				

         
				

					

###### The CSS for the presentation that includes images of text

					

Note that the CSS uses positioning to place the contents of the heading elements offscreen so that the text remains available to screen reader users.

         

```css
#Header h1 {
  background-image: url(pufferfish-logo.png);
  height: 195px;
  width: 290px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  margin-top: 0;
  position: absolute;
}
#Header h1 span {
  position: absolute;
  left: -999em;
}
#Header h2 {
  background-image: url(beauty.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  height: 234px;
  width: 33px;
  margin-left: 8px;
  position: absolute;
  margin-top: 250px;
}
#Header h2 span {
  position: absolute;
  left: -999em;
}
```

				

				

         
					

###### The CSS for the presentation that does not include images of text

         

```css
#Header h1 {
  font: normal 200%/100% Garamond, "Times New Roman", serif;
  margin-bottom: 0;
  color: #000099;
  background: #ffffff;
}
#Header h2 {
  font: normal 160%/100% Garamond, "Times New Roman", serif;
  margin-bottom: 0;
  color: #336600;
  background: #ffffff;
}
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

1. Check that the web page includes a control that allows users to select an alternate presentation.
2. Check that when the control is activated the resulting page includes text (programmatically determined text) wherever images of text had been used.

      

      

				

##### Expected Results

				

- All of the above checks are true

### C31: Using CSS Flexbox to reflow content <a id="c31"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to be able to present content without introducing a horizontal scroll bar at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels, or a vertical scroll bar at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels for text intended to scroll horizontally. This is done by using layout techniques that adapt to the available viewport space.

      

[Flexbox layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) define layout regions that reflow as needed to display the region on the screen. Although the exact layout therefore varies, the relationship of elements and the reading order remains the same when done right. This is an effective way to create designs that present well on different devices and for users with different zoom preferences.

      

The basic principles of flexbox layouts are to:

      

1. Define the size of layout regions using flexbox properties and media queries for specific viewport sizes, so they enlarge, shrink or wrap in the available space and respond to zoom levels;
2. Position the layout regions in the flexbox container as a row of adjacent flexbox items, which may wrap to new rows as needed in much the same way as words in a paragraph wrap.

      

Flexbox has the possibility to cause a keyboard navigation disconnect by using the order and reverse properties. The [CSS Flexible Box Layout module warns](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#order-accessibility) against resequencing content logic as they cause incorrect source ordering and are non-conforming.

#### Examples
##### Example 1: Medium complex flexbox layout in HTML and CSS

        

The following medium complex example uses HTML and CSS to create a flexbox layout. The layout regions adjust their size as the viewport is adjusted. When the total viewport width matches the width defined via media queries, columns wrap to be positioned below, rather than beside each other or vice versa.

        

The zoom level can be increased to 400% without requiring scrolling in more than one direction. This particular example uses percent sizes for the flex items by using the "flex-basis" property and are laid out in source order.

        

```html

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">

      </aside>
      <footer class="col">
        ...
      </footer>
    </body>
  </html>
```

        
        

Working example: [Using CSS Flexbox for Reflow](../../working-examples/css-flexbox/)

#### Tests
##### Procedure

        

1. Display the web page in a user agent capable of 400% zoom and set the viewport dimensions (in CSS pixels) to 1280 wide and 1024 high.
2. Zoom in by 400%.
3. For content read horizontally, check that all content and functionality is available without horizontal scrolling.
4. For content read vertically, check that all content and functionality is available without vertical scrolling.

      

> **Note:**
> >         
> 
> If the browser is not capable of zooming to 400%, you can reduce the width of the browser proportionally. For example, at 300% zoom the viewport should be sized to 960px wide.
> 
>

##### Expected Results

        

#3 and #4 are true.

### C32: Using media queries and grid CSS to reflow columns <a id="c32"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to be able to present content without introducing a horizontal scroll bar at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels, or a vertical scroll bar at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels for text intended to scroll horizontally. This is done by using layout techniques that adapt to the available viewport space.

      

[Grid layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) define layout regions that reflow as needed to display the region on the screen. Although the exact layout therefore varies, the relationship of elements and the reading order remains the same when done right. This is an effective way to create designs that present well on different devices and for users with different content-size preferences.

      

The basic principles of grid layouts are to:

      

1. Define the size of layout regions using grid properties and media queries for specific viewport sizes, so they enlarge, shrink or wrap in the available space and respond to zoom levels;
2. Position the layout regions in the grid container as a row of adjacent grid items, which may wrap to new rows as needed in much the same way as words in a paragraph wrap.

      

Use of grid layout CSS can cause a keyboard navigation disconnect by making the visual layout and source-code order different. The [CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1 warns](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#placement-a11y) against re-ordering content by grid item placement as they cause an incorrect focus order for keyboard users and others.

#### Examples
##### Grid layout in HTML and CSS - Medium complexity

        

The following medium complexity example uses HTML and CSS to create a grid layout. The layout regions adjust their size as the viewport is adjusted. When the total viewport width matches the width defined via media queries, columns wrap to be positioned below, rather than beside each other or vice versa.

        
        

The zoom level can be increased to 400% without requiring scrolling in more than one direction. This particular example uses fr units as a fraction of the free space of the grid container for the grid items by using the "grid-template-columns" property and are laid out in source order.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

        

1. Display the web page in a user agent capable of 400% zoom and set the viewport dimensions (in CSS pixels) to 1280 wide and 1024 high.
2. Zoom in by 400%.
3. For content read horizontally, check that all content and functionality is available without horizontal scrolling.
4. For content read vertically, check that all content and functionality is available without vertical scrolling.

      

If the browser is not capable of zooming to 400%, you can reduce the width or height of the browser proportionally. For example, at 300% zoom the viewport should be sized to 960px wide.

### C33: Allowing for Reflow with Long URLs and Strings of Text <a id="c33"></a>

#### Description
Long sets of characters without a space, such as URLs shown as content, can break reflow when the page is zoomed. The objective of this technique is to present URLs without introducing a horizontal scroll bar at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a vertical scroll bar at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. This is done by using CSS techniques that adapt to the available viewport space. Note: Using a human readable text link, rather than a long URL, is better for usability and accessibility.

  

By default most browsers will wrap long URLs at the following characters:

  

- "&" Ampersand
- "/" Forward Slash
- "-" Hyphen
- "?" Question Mark

 
  

Sometimes these are not enough to ensure that long URLs will not overflow the viewport.

#### Examples
##### Breaking long URLs

    

Using the following CSS will cause long URLs to break at appropriate places (hyphens, forward slashes, etc.) and within words without causing reflow.

    

List of CSS declarations used and why they are used:

    

- `overflow-wrap: break-word`: Allows words to be broken and wrapped within words.
- `word-wrap: break-word`: Allows words to be broken and wrapped within.

```css
a {
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
  word-wrap: break-word;
}
```

  

[Working Example](../../working-examples/css-reflow-url/)

#### Tests
##### Procedure

    

For strings of text that are wider than 320px check:

    

1. Display the web page in a user agent capable of 400% zoom and set the viewport dimensions (in CSS pixels) to 1280 wide and 1024 high.
2. Zoom in by 400%.
3. For content read horizontally, check that all content and functionality is available without horizontal scrolling.
4. For content read vertically, check that all content and functionality is available without vertical scrolling.

    

If the browser is not capable of zooming to 400%, you can reduce the width of the browser proportionally. For example, at 300% zoom the viewport should be sized to 960px wide.

### C35: Allowing for text spacing without wrapping <a id="c35"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow a user to override text spacing via user stylesheet, bookmarklet, extension, or application. Increased spacing between paragraphs, lines, words, and characters benefits people with low vision or some cognitive disabilities. Content needs to allow spacing changes without loss of content or functionality by allowing the elements containing the text to expand as needed.

         

**Where text is not intended to wrap**, authors should either:

         

- size containers to a have a value greater than the default width of the text, or
- allow the containers to expand in the direction of text.

         

There is some variability in the width that words or phrases will grow to when setting the letter and word spacing. If elements must use a fixed width, a safe value is 20% wider than the default maximum width. For example, if a small text-container allows for 20 characters, allowing enough width for 24 characters should allow enough space for text-spacing to be applied.

         

For boxes which can expand with the text, authors can take advantage of the `inline-block` value of the CSS `display` property and not set negative margins to allow for text-spacing overrides.

#### Examples
When a user adapts the page to increase the text spacing, text fits within the bounds of its containing box.

      

The `ex` unit has been used as as the closest available unit for character width, `ex` "Represents the x-height of the element's font." ([MDN page for CSS units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length)). It is not perfect, different characters have different default widths.

      

         

##### A box sized with space to allow for expansion

         

The containers are sized to a value greater than the default width of the text.

            

               

###### The CSS

```html
<style>
/* Links are less than 8em wide,
so 10em width of each li allows for expanded letter and word width */
nav li { width: 10em; }
</style>
```

            

            

               

###### The HTML

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li>
  <ul>
</nav>
```

            

            

If the navigation element used fix-width containers of the same size, the width would need to allow for text 20% larger than the longest word.

      

      

         

##### A box which expands with the text size

            

               

###### The CSS

```html
<style>
/* CSS containers are given a display of inline-block. No negative margins set. */
 nav li { display: inline-block; }
 </style>
```

            

            

               

###### The HTML

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li>
  <ul>
</nav>
```

            

            

In the case of variable-width text containers for each item, the parent item may need to allow for wrapping of the items.

            

[Working examples of #1 and #2](../../working-examples/css-text-spacing/) are available.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

            

For elements which contain text that is not intended to wrap:

            

1. Set zoom level to 100%.
2. Use a tool or another mechanism to apply the text spacing metrics (line height, and paragraph, letter, and word spacing), such as the [Text Spacing Bookmarklet](http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/tsbookmarklet.html) or a user-style browser plugin.
3. Check that all content and functionality is available e.g., text in containers is not truncated and does not overlap other content.

         

         

            

##### Expected Results

            

- #3 is true.

            

Where a page has multiple layouts (e.g. in a responsive design) text spacing should be tested in each layout.

### C36: Allowing for text spacing override <a id="c36"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow a user to override text spacing via user stylesheet, bookmarklet, extension, or application. Increased spacing between paragraphs, lines, words, and characters benefits people with low vision or some cognitive disabilities. Content needs to allow spacing changes without loss of content or functionality, so text containers must either have room for the text to expand or the container must be able to expand. This technique will typically apply to short strings of text such as in a navigation bar, as longer strings of text are increasingly likely to require wrapping to be readable when styles are changed.

				

In English languages, if authors do not set the CSS `height` property, it can help ensure paragraphs expand. Paragraphs need to allow text to increase vertically for languages or scripts such as English which are read horizontally or to increase horizontally for languages or scripts which are read vertically.

#### Examples
When a user adapts the page to increase the text spacing, text fits within the bounds of its containing box.

				
				

					

##### A paragraph expands vertically within container

               

                  

###### The CSS

```html
<style>
/* CSS: No height property is set.*/
</style>
```

###### The HTML

```html
<div class="card">
  <img alt="" src="image.png">
  <h3>Heading</h3>
  <p class="lede">Long lede paragraph...</p>
</div>
```

               

         

None of the paragraphs on this page have a height specified, so all are effectively using this technique.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

            

For elements which contain text that is intended to wrap:

            

1. Set zoom level to 100%.
2. Use a tool or another mechanism to apply the text spacing metrics (line height, and paragraph, letter, and word spacing), such as the [Text Spacing Bookmarklet](http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/tsbookmarklet.html) or a 
                  user-style browser plugin.
3. Check that all content and functionality is available e.g., text in containers is not truncated and does not overlap other content.

         

         

            

##### Expected Results

            

- #3 is true.

            

Where a page has multiple layouts (e.g. in a responsive design) text spacing should be tested in each layout.

### C38: Using CSS width, max-width and flexbox to fit labels and inputs <a id="c38"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to be able to present labels and inputs without introducing a horizontal scroll bar at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels for content intended to scroll vertically. When space is limited in the viewport for the label and input to sit next to each other horizontally, they will be changed to a vertical alignment. This is done by using CSS properties for `width`, `max-width` and flexbox that adapt to the available space.

      
      

Responsive layouts can add or remove columns or layout blocks, and each part of the layout can be wider or smaller at different points. This technique ensures labels and inputs do not break out of their layout area, including in one-column layouts where it would cause horizontal scrolling.

      

The basic approach for fitting labels and inputs is to:

      
      

1. Define the size of layout regions using flexbox properties and media queries for specific viewport sizes, so they enlarge, shrink or wrap in the available space and respond to zoom levels;
2. Position the layout regions in the flexbox container as a row of adjacent flexbox items, which may wrap to new rows as needed in much the same way as words in a paragraph wrap.
3. Define the width and max-width property for labels and inputs so they enlarge or shrink in the available space and respond to zoom levels.

      
      

All labels and inputs require design finesse by making sure the original size fits the biggest size of the available spaces to achieve good-looking results at a wide range of viewport sizes and zoom levels. For help on flexbox please see the [MDN article on Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox).

#### Examples
##### Fitting labels, inputs and flexbox layout with HTML and CSS.

        

The following example uses HTML and CSS to fit labels and inputs within various width containers, including the viewport. The layout regions adjust their size as the viewport is adjusted. The labels and inputs subsequently adjust their size to fit within the layout region containers.

        

The zoom level can be increased to 400% without requiring horizontal scrolling. This particular example uses a percent size for the `width` and `max-width` for the labels and inputs. The `max-width` is applied in order to fix elements spilling out of the grid in a cross-browser way, as replaced elements such as the `select` have intrinsic sizing.

```html
<style>

### C40: Creating a two-color focus indicator to ensure sufficient contrast with all components <a id="c40"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to create a two-color focus indicator that has sufficient contrast against any solid background color. This technique can avoid the need for multiple classes to ensure sufficient contrast of the focus indicator when viewed against different backgrounds.

			

Authors may apply this technique to sites that use a variety of different colored backgrounds. Although it is possible to create different colored focus indicators for different parts of a page, this can be time consuming and it can be easy to miss some components. However, if the focus indicator uses two highly-contrasting colors - a light color and a dark color - then the same indicator can be re-used, since at least one of the two colors will always have enough contrast against any background color.

			

As long as the two indicator colors have a contrast ratio of at least 9:1 with each other, at least one of the two colors is guaranteed to meet 3:1 contrast with any solid background color.

			

This technique only guarantees that an indicator will pass if the entire indicator is drawn over the background, not within the boundary of the focused component, and if the entire background behind the indicator is one single, solid color. For example, if the background is an image or gradient, or if the indicator is partially overlaid on top of a different UI component, it may still be necessary to compare the indicator pixel-by-pixel against the background.

			

In CSS, two-color indicators can be implemented by combining the `outline` and `box-shadow` properties with the `:focus` or `:focus-visible` pseudo-classes.

			

Avoid setting `outline: none` to use `box-shadow` on its own. User agents commonly suppress the `box-shadow` property in forced-color modes, so authors should avoid relying on `box-shadow` alone to implement focus indicators. If `box-shadow` only styling is required, consider combining it with an `outline: 2px transparent solid` property to ensure compatibility with forced-color modes.

#### Examples
This example demonstrates a simple implementation where focus styles are applied to all focusable components. In use on a more complex website care would need to be taken that these styles are not overridden by more specific styles.

			

				

##### A thick two-color indicator

				

In this example, the indicator consists of two solid bands of color. Because each color band is 2 CSS pixels thick, either color band is large enough to meet the minimum indicator size requirement on its own. As long as one of the two colors has 3:1 change contrast with the pixels behind and around the focus indicator, the indicator will satisfy both the Focus Appearance and Non-Text Contrast success criteria.

				
```css
*:focus {
	/* inner indicator */
	outline: 2px #F9F9F9 solid;
	outline-offset: 0;
	/* outer indicator */
	box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px #193146;
}
```

				

[Working example of a thick two-color indicator](../../working-examples/css-two-focus-colors/)

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For each focusable user interface component:

				

1. Check that the two colors in the focus indicator have a contrast ratio that is 9:1 or greater with each other.
2. Check that each color band is at least 2 CSS pixels thick.
3. Check that the indicator only appears overtop one solid background color at a time.

### C42: Using min-height and min-width on target container to ensure sufficient target spacing <a id="c42"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that links in navigation or pagination menus will be spaced so that they fall within an area that measures at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels if the target area itself is smaller than that. The aim is to provide an adequate target clearance so the offset to adjacent targets is sufficient to prevent accidental pointer activation of adjacent targets.

#### Examples
The following example can be seen in the [working example](../../working-examples/css-24px-target-size/).

			

				

##### Using a display value of flex with min-height and min-width

				

This example uses `min-height` and `min-width` on the list items containing the pagination links. The links don't meet the 24 by 24 CSS pixels size requirement, but centering the links inside containers that are at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels ensures sufficient spacing. The links' 24 CSS pixel diameter circles will each be completely within their containing list items, so they won't intersect each other.

				
					
					Example of using CSS to ensure enough spacing around targets
				
				

					

###### The HTML

```html
<nav aria-label="pagination">
  <ol>
    <li><a class="previous">previous</a></li>
    <li><a aria-current="page">1</li>
    <li><a href="/page-2">2</a></li>
    <li><a href="/page-3">3</a></li>
    <li><a href="/page-4">4</a></li>
    <li><a href="/page-5">5</a></li>
    <li><a href="/pages-6-10">next</a></li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```

				

				

					

###### The CSS

```css
ol {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  list-style: none;
}

li {
  margin: 3px;
  min-height: 24px;
  min-width: 24px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For each undersized target that has no sufficiently large equivalent, that isn't in a sentence or otherwise
					constrained by the `line-height` of non-target text, that has had its size modified by the author, and whose
					presentation isn't essential:

				

1. Draw a 24px diameter circle centered on the target's bounding box.
2. Check that the circle from #1 does not intersect any other target.
3. Check that the circle from #1 does not intersect any other undersized target's circle.

### C43: Using CSS scroll-padding to un-obscure content <a id="c43"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that user interface components (for example: links, buttons, and form fields) that are initially completely obscured by a fixed-position component can still be accessed by users. In this example, this is achieved using CSS `padding` and `scroll-padding` properties to create space underneath the site footer and allow the link in the footer to scroll into view when it is focused with a keyboard.

#### Examples
##### Using CSS scroll-padding to un-obscure content

				

This example shows a situation where there is a fixed-position banner at the bottom of the screen that is covering up the site footer, which contains a link. This type of fixed-position banner is a common design for cookie-consent banners.

        
          

This example demonstrates a technique to un-obscure content underneath a fixed-position banner. To prevent the page becoming unusable at smaller screen sizes, the banner becomes un-fixed. To observe the `scroll-padding` effect you will need to use a viewport over 800px wide.

### C45: Using CSS :focus-visible to provide keyboard focus indication <a id="c45"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide custom styles for interactive elements when they receive keyboard focus. In this example, this is achieved using the CSS `:focus-visible` pseudo-class.

      

Styles defined with the regular `:focus` pseudo-class are applied whenever an element has focus, regardless of how it received focus. In contrast, user agents apply additional heuristics and logic to decide when to show `:focus-visible` styles – in particular, browsers always show these styles when a user is navigating using the keyboard, but will generally *not* show them as a result of a mouse/pointer interaction (with the exception of elements that also support keyboard input, such as `<input>` elements). This allows authors to provide strong visible focus indication for keyboard users, without forcing them on mouse/pointer users who may not necessarily want or need them (for instance, because they find them visually distracting).

			

This satisfies the requirement of providing a "mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible".

			

> **Note:**
> > 				
> 
> This technique is only sufficient *if* it uses styles that provide a *visible* focus indicator.
> 
> 
>

			

> **Note:**
> > 				
> 
> There may be situations where mouse/pointer users could also benefit from having a visible focus indicator, even though they did not set focus to an element using the keyboard. As a best practice, consider still providing an explicit `:focus` style for these cases.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
##### Using CSS :focus-visible to provide keyboard focus indication

				

In this example, we have a standard `<button>` control in the HTML.

        

By default, in all modern browsers, this button does not show any focus indication when activated using a mouse/pointer. Browsers show their default focus outline/indication when a user sets focus on the button using Tab.

        

In order to make this focus indication more prominent, we use the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class selector to define a more intentional and pronounced focus style.

				

Working example: [Using CSS `:focus-visible` to provide keyboard focus indication](../../working-examples/css-focus-visible/).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,
              initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
  <title>Using CSS :focus-visible to
         provide keyboard focus indication</title>
  <style>
    /* Specific :focus-visible styles */

    :focus-visible {
      outline: 5px solid red;
    }
    …
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  …
  <button>Example button</button>
  …
</body>
</html>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For each user interface component that can receive keyboard focus:

				

1. Set focus to the interface component using the keyboard (generally, navigating to the component using Tab/Shift+Tab)
2. Verify that once the component has received focus, a focus indicator is visible

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- Check #2 is true.

### G4: Allowing the content to be paused and restarted from where it was paused <a id="g4"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a way to pause movement or scrolling of content. If the user needs to pause the movement, to reduce distraction or to have time to read it, they can do so, and then restart it as needed. This mechanism can be provided either through interactive controls that conform to WCAG or through keyboard shortcuts. If keyboard shortcuts are used, they are documented.

#### Examples
- A site contains a scrolling news banner at the top of the page. Users who need more time to read it can press the Escape key to pause the scrolling. Pressing Escape again restarts it.
- A web page contains a link labeled "How to tie a shoe" which links to an animation. Text  immediately preceding the link informs the user that pressing the spacebar will pause the animation and restart it again.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

On a page with moving or scrolling content,

         

1. Use the mechanism provided in the web page or by the user agent to pause the moving or scrolling content.
2. Check that the moving or scrolling has stopped and does not restart by itself.
3. Use the mechanism provided to restart the moving content.
4. Check that the movement or scrolling has resumed from the point where it was stopped.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 and #4 are true.

### G8: Providing a movie with extended audio descriptions <a id="g8"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a second version of video content that provides extended audio descriptions in the same [human language]() as the video. One of the difficult things about creating traditional audio descriptions is that the narrator sometimes has to provide a lot of information during very short pauses in dialogue. Extended audio description temporarily pauses the audio and video to allow critical information to be delivered when pauses in dialogue are insufficient for adequate description.

      

Providing a second version of the movie with extended audio descriptions will make this content accessible for blind people who need to hear not only the dialogue but also the context and other aspects of the video that are not communicated by the characters' dialogue alone, and for which there is insufficient time during the natural dialogue.

      

Because it disrupts viewing for those who do not need the additional description, techniques that allow you to turn the feature on and off are often provided. Alternately, versions with and without the additional description can be provided.

#### Examples
An alternate version of an online video of a family escaping from a burning building: there is a continuous dialogue between the husband and wife about where the children are. Meanwhile, in the background, a wall caves in. This is important information in the story because it will block their exit from that part of the building. The video track halts (same frame is repeated) while a narrator gives the details about the wall falling and the video continues.

         
      

      

         
            

A training film has narrative that runs almost continuously throughout. An alternate version is available for people who have difficulty viewing the video portion. The alternate version freezes the video and provides audio description of key information.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Open the version of the movie that includes extended audio descriptions.
2. Check that the video halts for extended audio description when there is not enough space to include necessary narration between the natural dialogue.
3. Check that the necessary information is in the audio description.
4. If the alternate version(s) are on a separate page, check for the availability of link(s) to allow the user to get to the other versions.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #2, #3 and #4 are true.

### G9: Creating captions for live synchronized media <a id="g9"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear to be able
            to access real-time synchronized media broadcasts in the same [human language]() as the original. It is more difficult to create
            accurate real-time captions because there is little time to correct mistakes
            or to listen a second time or consult someone to be sure the words are
            accurately reproduced. It is also harder to simplify or paraphrase
            information if it is flowing too quickly.

      

Real-time typing text entry techniques exist using stenographic and rapid
            typing technologies. Re-voicing speech-to-text (where a person listens to
            speech and then carefully re-voices it into a computer trained to their
            speech) is used today for telephone relay services and may be used in the
            future for captioning. Eventually speech-to-text with correction will be
            possible.

#### Examples
A television studio uses a real-time captioning service
                to create captions for its evening news online.

       

       

		   

A user watches an online seminar on their mobile device, including captioning provided through the use of Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART). The captions provided also benefit in-person participants who need captioning and can view the information on their own device.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that a procedure and policy are in place to ensure that captions are delivered in real-time.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #1 is true.

### G10: Creating components using a technology that supports the accessibility
          API features of the platforms on which the user agents will be run to expose the
          names and roles, allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide
          notification of changes <a id="g10"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow assistive technology to
            understand web content so that it can convey equivalent information to the
            user through an alternate user interface.

      

Sometimes content is not created using markup language but rather using a
            programming language or tools. In many cases, these technologies have
            interface components that are already programmed to interface with
            accessibility APIs. If an author uses these components and fills in the
            properties (e.g., name, etc.), the resulting user interface components in the
            content will be accessible to assistive technology.

      

However, if an author wants to create a user interface component that is new
            and they cannot use standard components, then they need to be sure to add
            the accessibility provisions themselves - and implement them in a way that
            is compatible with the accessibility API.

      

After completion, the custom component should be tested for Accessibility Support.

#### Examples
- A web page uses java to create an applet. A group of
                authors wants to create an entirely new type of interface component
                so they cannot use existing Java objects. They use Java swing classes
                to create their component because the Java swing classes already
                have provisions for connecting to different accessibility APIs.
                Using the Java swing classes they are able to create an interface
                component that exposes its name and role, is able to be set by AT
                and alerts AT to any updates.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Render content using an accessible User Agent.
2. Use an Accessibility Tool designed for the Accessibility API of the User agent to evaluate each user interface component.
3. Check that name and role for each user interface component is found by the tool.
4. Change the values on the component.
5. Check that the Accessibility tool is alerted.
6. Check that the component works with assistive technologies.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #3, #5 and #6 are true for each user interface component.

### G11: Creating content that blinks for less than 5 seconds <a id="g11"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to minimize the distraction caused by blinking content and enable users to re-focus on the other content on the page.

      

Blinking content can be created using a variety of technologies, many of which include options to loop blinking content continuously or to otherwise specify the amount of time the blinking content is displayed. Limiting the blinking of content to five seconds minimizes the distraction that blinking can cause. This will benefit people with certain types of learning disabilities and people with low vision.

#### Examples
- An animated image is used to highlight items on sale. Within a list of items for purchase, an image of a red tag followed by the phrase "On sale" is used to indicate items being offered at a reduced price. The image of the red tag blinks on loading of the page and stops within five seconds.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Find all items that blink.
2. For each item that blinks, determine if the interval between the start and end of the blinking is less than five seconds.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 is true.

### G13: Describing what will happen before a change to a form control that causes a change of context to occur is made <a id="g13"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide information to users about
            what will happen when a change to a form control results in a change of
            context. Because changing the value of a form control does not typically
            result in a change of context, it is important that authors provide
            instructions that make the user aware of the behavior in advance. Where
            possible, it is a good idea to programmatically associate the instructions
            describing the change with the form control itself.

      

The following are some examples of how to provide the instruction in different situations.

      

- Provide instruction on the web page with reading order that precedes the user interface element that causes change of context by change of setting.
- For a multi-step process where users must complete particular steps in order to reach the user interface element where changes of setting would cause a change of context, provide the instruction as part of the process prior to the step where they would encounter the change of context.
- In the case of an intranet where user training is required prior to the use of a web application where user interface elements that cause changes of context when settings are changed, instruction is provided as part of the training.

#### Examples
- A select dropdown at the top of a page includes
                options for German, French and Spanish. Instructions preceding
                the dropdown instruct the user that the language will be
                changed upon selecting an option.
- A 50-question online survey displays one question at a time,
                with each answer marked up as a toggle button.
                Instructions appear at the beginning of the survey that
                explain that users will be taken to the next question of the
                survey upon selecting an answer to each question.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

- Locate content where changing the setting of a form control
                  results in a change of context
- Check to see that an explanation of what will happen when the
                  control is changed is available prior to the controls activation

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #2 is true.

### G14: Ensuring that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text <a id="g14"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that when color differences are used to convey information, such as required form fields, the information conveyed by the color differences are also conveyed explicitly in text.

#### Examples
##### A color-coded schedule

         
            

The schedule for sessions at a technology conference is organized into three tracks. Sessions for Track 1 are displayed over a blue background. Sessions in Track 2 are displayed over a yellow background. Sessions in Track 3 are displayed on a green background. After the name of each session is a code identifying the track in text: T1 for Track 1, T2 for Track 2, and T3 for Track 3.

         
      

      

         

##### A color-coded schedule with icons

         
            

The schedule for sessions at a technology conference is organized into three tracks. Next to the title of each session is an icon consisting of a colored circle with a number in the middle showing what track it belongs to: blue circles with the number 1 represent track 1, yellow circles with the number 2 represent Track 2, and green circles with the number 3 represent Track 3. Each icon is associated with a text alternative reading "Track 1," "Track 2," or "Track 3," as appropriate.

         
      

      

         

##### A form with required fields

         
            

A form contains several required fields. The labels for the required fields are displayed in red. In addition, at the end of each label is an asterisk character, *. The instructions for completing the form indicate that "all required fields are displayed in red and marked with an asterisk *", followed by an example.

            

> **Note:**
> >                
> 
> Asterisks may not be read by all screen readers (in all reading modes) and may be difficult for users with low vision because they are rendered in a smaller size than default text. It is important for authors to include the text indicating that asterisk is used and to consider increasing the size of the asterisk that is presented.
> 
> 
>

         
      

      

         

##### A form with a green submit button

         
            

An on-line loan application explains that green buttons advance in the process and red buttons cancel the process. A form contains a green button containing the text
                *Go*. The instructions say "Press the button labeled
                *Go*
                to submit your results and proceed to the next step."

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each item where a color difference is used to convey information:

         

1. Check that the information conveyed is also available in text and that the text is not conditional content.

### G15: Using a tool to ensure that content does not violate the general flash threshold or red flash threshold <a id="g15"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of testing for violations of the general and red flash thresholds is to allow people who have photosensitive seizures to view websites without encountering material that is likely to cause a seizure. Warnings can be provided but people may miss them and children may not be able to read or understand them. With this technique all material is checked and if it violates flash or red flash thresholds it is either not put on the site or it is modified so that it does not violate the thresholds.

#### Examples
- An animation of a thunderstorm shows six flashes of lightning. The flashes are so fast and large that the general flash threshold is violated when tested with a flash analysis tool. The animation is modified to create a short pause after each pair of lightning flashes. After the changes are made, the animation does not violate the general flash threshold.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

Check to see to see that content does not violate the general flash and/or red flash threshold

         

1. use a tool  to determine that neither the General Flash nor Red Flash threshold were exceeded

### G18: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text)
          and background behind the text <a id="g18"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
            that is presented over a background. For Success Criterion 1.4.3, this technique describes the minimum contrast ratio for text that is less than 18 point (if not bold) and less than 14 point (if bold). For Success Criterion 1.4.6, this technique relaxes the 7:1 contrast ratio requirement  for text that is at least 18 point (if not bold) or at least 14 point (if bold).

      

> **Note:**

> When evaluating this success criterion, the font size in points should be obtained from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way that user agents do. Point sizes are based on the CSS pt size [CSS3 Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-lengths). The ratio between sizes in points and CSS pixels is 1pt = 1.333px, therefore 14pt and 18pt are equivalent to approximately 18.5px and 24px.

If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the
            relative luminance of the text can be maintained by making sure that each
            of the text letters have 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background.

      

If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned) then
            the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the
            letters maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background behind them
            even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background.

      

For example, if a letter is lighter at the top than it is a the bottom, it may be difficult to maintain the contrast ratio between the letter and the background over the full letter. In this case, the designer might darken the background behind the letter, or add a thin black outline (at least one pixel wide) around the letter in order to keep the contrast ratio between the letter and the background above 4.5:1.

      

The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the
            relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes across
            the page.

      

For example, if a page is very light on one edge and fades to very dark on the other edge, there is no color that can run across the page and meet the contrast guidelines on both edges. One way of addressing this would be to change the lightness of the letters as well so that each letter always meets the contrast ratio for the background that is immediately behind the letter.

      

Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the
            necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not
            normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.

#### Examples
- A black background is chosen so that light colored letters that match the company logo can be used.
- Text is placed over a picture of the college campus.
                Since a wide variety of colors and shades appear in the picture,
                the area behind the text is fogged white so that the picture is very
                faint and the maximum darkness is still light enough to maintain a
                4.5:1 contrast ratio with the black text written over the picture.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Measure the relative luminance of each letter (unless they are all
                  uniform) using the formula:

2. Measure the relative luminance of the background pixels
                  immediately next to the letter using same formula.
3. Calculate the contrast ratio using the following
                  formula.

               

- (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where

                     

- L1 is the
                          [relative luminance]()
                          of the lighter of the foreground or background colors, and
- L2 is the
                          [relative luminance]()
                          of the darker of the foreground or background colors.
4. Check that the contrast ratio is equal to or
                  greater than 4.5:1

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #4 is true.

      

      

Before May 2021 the value of 0.04045 in the definition was different (0.03928). It was taken from an older version of the specification and has been updated. It has no practical effect on the calculations in the context of these guidelines.

### G19: Ensuring that no component of the content flashes more than three times in any 1-second period <a id="g19"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to avoid flashing at rates that are known to cause seizures if the flashes are bright and large enough. Since some users may be using screen enlargers, this technique limits the flashing of any size content to no more than three flashes in any 1-second period.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> This technique is stricter than the Level A success criteria but is easier to test and can be used to meet the Level A success criteria because all failure thresholds in the Level A success criteria involve flashing 3.5 flashes or more within one second. Most content does not flash at all and even content that blinks does not blink this fast except on rare occasions.  Therefore, in order to avoid having to carry out the more complex testing specified by the Success Criteria, one could follow this technique to ensure that content only flashes one, two, or at most three times in any 1-second period.
> 
> 
>          
> 
> Regarding 3.5 Flashes; if there are seven transitions from dark to light or light to dark, it would be 3.5 flashes, which is more than the allowed three flashes (six transitions).
> 
> 
>

      

**Examples of 3.5 flashes or seven transitions:**

      

- STARTING DARK-LIGHT-DARK-LIGHT-DARK-LIGHT-DARK-LIGHT  or
- STARTING LIGHT-DARK-LIGHT-DARK-LIGHT-DARK-LIGHT-DARK.

#### Examples
- Content has lightning flashes.  Content is designed so that lightning only flashes two or three times without a pause in flashing.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that there are no more than three flashes during any 1-second period.
2. If there are three flashes, check that the Light/Dark status at the end of the 1-second period is the same as at the start.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Both checks #1 and #2 are true.

### G21: Ensuring that users are not trapped in content <a id="g21"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that keyboard users do not become trapped in a subset of the content that can only be exited using a mouse or pointing device. A common example is content rendered by plug-ins. Plug-ins are user agents that render content inside the user agent host window and respond to all user actions that takes place while the plug-in has the focus. If the plug-in does not provide a keyboard mechanism to return focus to the parent window, users who must use the keyboard may become trapped in the plug-in content.

      

This problem can be avoided by using one of the following mechanisms to provide a way for users to escape the subset of the content:

      

- Ensuring that the keyboard function for advancing focus within content (commonly the tab key) exits the subset of the content after it reaches the final navigation location.
- Providing a keyboard function to move the focus out of the subset of the content. Be sure to document the feature in an accessible manner within the subset.
- If the technology used in the subset of the content natively provides a "move to parent" keyboard command, documenting that command before the user enters the plug-in so they know how to get out again.

      

If the author uses a technology that allows users to enter the sub-content with keyboard and does not allow users to exit the sub-content with keyboard by default (i.e., it is not a feature of the web content technology or its user agents) then, in order to implement this technique the author would either build such a capability into their content or not use the technology.

#### Examples
- Once a user tabs into an applet, further tabs are handled by the applet preventing the person from tabbing out. However, the applet is designed so that it returns keyboard focus back to the parent window when the person finishes tabbing through the tab sequence in the applet.
- A page that includes content that is not accessibility-supported contains instructions about how to move focus back to the accessibility-supported content via the keyboard. The instructions precede the non accessibility-supported content.
- The help information available from the content that is not accessibility supported documents how to move focus back to the accessibility-supported content via the keyboard, and the help information can be accessed via the keyboard.
- The help information available for the web page documents how to move focus
                from the content that is not accessibility supported to the accessibility-supported content via the keyboard, and the help information can be accessed via the keyboard.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Tab through content from start to finish.
2. Check to see that keyboard focus is not trapped in any of the content.
3. If keyboard focus appears to be trapped in any of the content, check that help information is available explaining how to exit the content and can be accessed via the keyboard.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 is false

### G53: Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with the text of the enclosing sentence <a id="g53"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to identify the purpose of a link from the link and its sentence context. The sentence enclosing the link provides context for an otherwise unclear link. The description lets a user distinguish this link from links in the web page that lead to other destinations and helps the user determine whether to follow the link. Note that simply providing the URI of the destination is generally not sufficiently descriptive.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> These descriptions will be most useful to the user if the additional information needed to understand the link precedes the link. If the additional information follows the link, there can be confusion and difficulty for screen reader users who are reading through the page in order (top to bottom).
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
##### 

         
            

A web page contains the sentence "To advertise on this page,
                [click here](http://example.com)."

            

Although the link phrase 'click here' is not sufficient to understand the link, the information needed precedes the link in the same sentence.

         
      

      

         

##### 

         
            

In the news summary containing the sentence "The Smallville Times
                [reports that](http://example.com)
                the School Board chose a 2007 school calendar that starts on August 27.", the words "reports that" are a link to an article in the Smallville Times about the School Board meeting.

            

> **Note:**
> >                
> 
> Although this example satisfies the Success Criterion, putting information needed to understand the link after the link in this way is awkward for those who are reading through the document with a screen reader.
> 
> 
>

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each link in the content that uses this technique:

         

1. Check that the link is part of a sentence
2. Check that text of the link combined with the text of its enclosing sentence describes the purpose of the link

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- The above checks are true.

### G57: Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence <a id="g57"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that the order of content presented to assistive technologies allows the user to make sense of the content. Some techniques permit the content to be rendered visually in a meaningful sequence even if this is different from the order in which the content is encoded in the underlying source file.

		

For example, when mixing languages with different directionality in HTML, the bidirectional algorithm may position punctuation in the wrong location in the visual rendering. The visual rendering problem could be corrected by moving the punctuation in the content stream so that the bidirectional algorithm positions it as desired, but this would expose the incorrect content order to assistive technology. The content is both rendered in the correct order visually and exposed to assistive technology in the correct order by using markup to override the bidirectional algorithm.

		

When rendered visually, white space characters such as space or tab may not appear to be part of the content. However, when inserted into the content to control visual formatting, they may interfere with the meaning of the content.

		

At a larger granularity, controlling the placement of blocks of content in an HTML document using layout tables may produce a rendering in which related information is positioned together visually, but separated in the content stream. Since layout tables are read row by row, if the caption of an illustration is placed in the row following the illustration, it may be impossible to associate the caption with the image.

#### Examples
A web page from a museum exhibition contains a navigation bar containing a long list of links. The page also contains an image of one of the pictures from the exhibition, a heading for the picture, and a detailed description of the picture. The links in the navigation bar form a meaningful sequence. The heading, image, and text of the description also form a meaningful sequence. CSS is used to position the elements on the page.

			

###### HTML

```html
<h1>My Museum Page</h1>
<ul id="nav">
  <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
  ...
  <li><a href="#">Link 10</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="description">
  <h2>Mona Lisa</h2>
  <div>
    <img src="img.png" alt="Mona Lisa">
  </div>
  <p>...detailed description of the picture...</p>
</div>
```

			
			

###### CSS

			

```css
ul#nav {
  float: left;
  width: 9em;
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0.5em;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #063;
}

ul#nav a {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #063;
}
div#description {
  margin-left: 11em;
}
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

1. Linearize content using a standard approach for the technology (e.g., removing layout styles or running a linearization tool)
2. Check to see if the order of content yields the same meaning as the original

		

		

			

##### Expected Results

			

- Check #2 is true.

### G59: Placing the interactive elements in an order that follows sequences and relationships within the content <a id="g59"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that interactive elements receive focus in an order that follows sequences and relationships in the content. When designing the content, the interactive elements such as links and form controls are placed in the content so that the default tab order follows the sequences and relationships in the content. Each technology defines its default tab order, so the mechanism for placing the controls in the content will depend on the technology used.

      

As an example, in HTML, the default focus order follows the order in which elements appear in the content source. When the order of the HTML source matches the visual order of the web page, tabbing through the content follows the visual layout of the content. When the source order does not match the visual order, the tab order through the content must reflect the logical relationships in the content that are displayed visually.

#### Examples
- A form contains two text input fields that are to be filled in sequentially. The first text input field is placed first in the content, the second input field is placed second.
- A form contains two, side-by-side sections of information. One section contains information about an applicant; the other section contains information about the applicant's spouse. All the interactive elements in the applicant section receive focus before any of the elements in the spouse section. The elements in each section receive focus in the reading order of that section.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Determine the order of interactive elements in the content.
2. Determine the logical order of interactive elements.
3. Check that the order of the interactive elements in the content is the same as the logical order.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #3 is true.

### G60: Playing a sound that turns off automatically within three seconds <a id="g60"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to allow authors to play a sound on their
            web page but avoid the problem of users not being able to use their screen
            readers due to interference by the content sound. It also allows the author
            to avoid putting controls on the web page to control the sound - and the problem
            faced by users with screen readers in finding the control (when unable
            to hear their screen reader).

      

The technique is simple. The sound plays for 3 or less seconds and stops
            automatically.

#### Examples
- Example 1: A web page opens with a trumpet fanfare and then goes silent
- Example 2: A homepage opens with the chairman saying "Binfor, where quality is our business."  then going silent.
- Example 3: A web page opens with instructions on how to get started:  "To begin, press the enter key."
- Example 4: A web page opens with a warning and then goes silent.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Load the web page
2. Check that all sound that plays automatically stops in 3 seconds
                  or less

### G61: Presenting repeated components in the same relative order each time they
          appear <a id="g61"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to make content easier to use by making
            the placement of repeated components more predictable. This technique helps
            maintain consistent layout or presentation between web pages by presenting components that are repeated in the set of web pages in the same relative order each time they appear. Other
            components can be inserted between them, but their relative order is not
            changed.

      

This technique also applies to navigational components that are repeated.
            Web pages often contain a navigation menu or other
            navigational component that allows the user to jump to other web pages. This technique makes the placement of navigational
            components more predictable by presenting the links or programmatic
            references inside a navigational component in the same relative order each
            time the navigational component is repeated. Other links can be removed or
            inserted between the existing ones, for example to allow navigation inside a
            subsection of a set of web pages, but the relative order is not
            changed.

#### Examples
- A website has a logo, a title, a search form and a navigation bar
                at the top of each page; these appear in the same relative order on
                each page where they are repeated. On one page the search form is
                missing but the other items are still in the same order.
- A website has a left-hand navigation menu with links to the major
                sections of the site. When the user follows a link to another
                section of the site, the links to the major sections appear in the
                same relative order in the next page. Sometime links are dropped and
                other links are added, but the other links always stay in the same
                relative order. For example, on a website of a company that sells
                products and offers training, when a user moves from the section on
                products to the section on training, the links to individual
                products are removed from the navigation list, while links to
                training offerings are added.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. List components that are repeated on each web page in a set
                  of web pages (for example, on each page in a website).
2. For each component, check that it appears in the same relative
                  order with regard to other repeated components on each web page where it appears.
3. For each navigational component, check that the links or
                  programmatic references are always in the same relative order.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 is true.
- #3 is true.

### G68: Providing a short text alternative that describes the purpose of live
          audio-only and live video-only content <a id="g68"></a>

#### Description
This technique provides a short text alternative for Live audio-only and live video-only content. This text may be used in combination with a full text alternative for time-based media (for audio or video), or in combination with audio description (for video).
            Those alternatives, however, are not part of this technique. The purpose of
            this technique is to ensure that the user can determine what the non-text
            content is, even if they cannot access it. NOTE: Even if full alternatives
            are also available, it is important that users be able to identify the
            non-text content when they encounter it so that they are not confused, and
            so that they can associate it with the full alternative when they encounter
            it.

#### Examples
- A live video feed of the east coast highway has the
                    following descriptive label "Live video picture of East
                    Coast Highway just south of the I-81 interchange showing
                    current traffic conditions."
- A live audio feed of the Mississippi House of
                    Representatives has the following descriptive label "Live
                    audio from the microphones in the Mississippi House of
                    Representatives."

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Remove, hide, or mask the non-text content.
2. Display the short text alternative(s).
3. Check that the purpose of the non-text content is clear, even if content is lost.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #3 is true.

### G69: Providing an alternative for time based media <a id="g69"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting the information in a synchronized media presentation.

      

In a synchronized media presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including:

      

- dialogue,
- sounds (natural and artificial),
- the setting and background,
- the actions and expressions of people, animals, etc.,
- text or graphics,
- and more.

      

In order to present the same information in accessible form, this technique involves creating a document that tells the same story and presents the same information as the synchronized media in the same [human language]().  Such a document is sometimes called a screenplay. It includes all the important dialogue and actions as well as descriptions of backgrounds etc. that are part of the story.

      

If an actual screenplay was used to create the synchronized media in the first place, this can be a good place to start.  In production and editing however, the synchronized media usually changes from the screenplay.  For this technique, the original screenplay would be corrected to match the dialogue and what actually happens in the final edited form of the synchronized media.

      

In addition, some special types of synchronized media include interaction that has to occur at particular places in the playing of the synchronized media.   Sometimes it may result in an action taking place (e.g., something is purchased, sent, done, etc.). Sometimes it may change the course of the synchronized media (e.g., the synchronized media has multiple paths that are determined by user input).  In those cases links or some other mechanism would be used in the alternative for time-based media to allow people using the alternative to be able to have the same options and abilities as those using the synchronized media.

#### Examples
- A training film shows employees how to use a new piece of equipment.  It involves a person talking throughout while they demonstrate the operation.  The screenplay used to create the training film is used as a starting point. It is then edited and corrected to match the dialogue etc.  The film and the resulting alternative for time-based media are then made available on the company website. Employees can then use either or both to learn how to use the machine.
- An interactive shopping environment is created that allows users to steer themselves around in a virtual store and shop.  An alternative for time-based media allows the users to access the same shopping in text with links to choose aisles and to purchase things instead of dragging them into a virtual shopping basket.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. View the synchronized media presentation while referring to the alternative for time-based media.
2. Check that the dialogue in the alternative for time-based media matches the dialogue in the synchronized media presentation.
3. Check that the alternative for time-based media has descriptions of sounds.
4. Check that the alternative for time-based media has descriptions of setting and setting changes.
5. Check that  the alternative for time-based media has descriptions of actions and expressions of any 'actors' (people, animals etc).
6. If the alternate version(s) are on a separate page, check for the availability of link(s) to allow the user to get to the other versions.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2, 3, 4, 5 are true.

### G73: Providing a long description in another location with a link to it that
          is immediately adjacent to the non-text content <a id="g73"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a way to link to remote long
            descriptions.

      

With this technique, the long description is provided in another location
            than the non-text content. This could be at another location within the same
            URI or at another URI. A link to that long description is provided that is
            immediately adjacent to the non-text content. The link can be immediately
            before or after the non-text content. If the description is located along
            with other text then put "End of description" at the end so that they know
            when to stop reading and return to the main content. If a "Back" button will
            not take the person back to the point from which they jumped, then a link
            back to the non-text content location is provided.

#### Examples
##### Bar chart

         
            

There is a bar chart on a web page showing the sales for the top
                three salespeople.

            

The short text alternative says "October sales chart for top three
                salespeople."

            

Immediately after the non-text content is a small image denoting a
                long description. The alternate text for the image is "Long
                description of chart". The image links to the bottom of the page
                where there is a section titled "Description of charts on this
                page". The link points to this specific description: "Sales for
                October show Mary leading with 400 units. Mike follows closely with
                389. Chris rounds out our top 3 with sales of 350. [end of
                description]"

         
      

      

         

##### Bar chart - in non-HTML technology where user agent "back"
              is not supported for security reasons.

         
            

There is a bar chart on a web page showing the sales for the top
                three salespeople.

            

The short text alternative says "October sales chart for top three
                salespeople."

            

Immediately after the non-text content is a small image denoting the
                long description. The alternate text for the image is "Long
                description of chart". The image links to another page titled
                "Description of charts in October Sales Report". The description
                link points to this specific description: "Sales for October show
                Mary leading with 400 units. Mike follows closely with 389. Chris
                rounds out our top 3 with sales of 350. End of description.
                <link>Back to Sales Chart</link>"

         
      

      

         

##### Caption used as link

         
            

There is a chart. The figure caption immediately below the chart
                serves as a link to the long description. The Title attribute of the
                link makes it clear that this is a link to a long description.

         
      

      

         

##### Transcript of an audio-only file

         
            

There is a recording of a speech by Martin Luther King. Links to the
                audio file and the transcript appear side by side.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. check for the presence of a link immediately before or after the
                  non-text content
2. check that the link is a valid link that points directly to the
                  long description of this particular non-text content.
3. check that the long description conveys the same information as
                  the non-text content
4. check for the availability of a link or back function to get the
                  user back to the original location of the non-text content

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

All 4 of the above are true

### G74: Providing a long description in text near the non-text content, with a
          reference to the location of the long description in the short description <a id="g74"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a long description without
            requiring the user to jump off to another location for the description. It
            also allows all users to see the description which may be useful to anyone
            who might miss some features in the non-text content.

      

With this technique, the long description is provided as part of the
            standard presentation (i.e., everyone receives it). The description is
            located near the non-text content but does not have to be the very next
            item. For example, there may be a caption under a chart with the long
            description provided in the following paragraph.

      

The location of this long description is then provided within the short text
            alternative so the user knows where to look for it if they cannot view the
            non-text content.

#### Examples
##### Bar chart

         
            

There is a bar chart on a web page showing the sales for the top
                three salespeople.

            

The short text alternative says: "October sales chart for top three
                salespeople. Details in text following the chart:"

            

The following is in the paragraph immediately below the chart. "Sales for October show Mary leading with 400 units. Mike follows closely with 389. Chris rounds out our top 3 with sales of 350."

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. check that the short text alternative includes the location of
                  the long description
2. Check that the long description is near the non-text content
                  both visually and in the linear reading order
3. check that the long description conveys the same information as
                  the non-text content

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

All 3 of the above are true

### G78: Providing a second, user-selectable, audio track that includes audio descriptions <a id="g78"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide an audio (spoken) version of information that is provided visually so that it is possible for people who cannot see to be able to understand audio-visual material.

      

Since most user agents today cannot merge multiple sound tracks, this technique adds the additional audio information to synchronized media by providing an option which allows users to replace the soundtrack with a new copy of the original soundtrack that has the additional audio description added in the same [human language](). This added information focuses on actions, characters, scene changes and on-screen text (not captions) that are important to understanding the content.

      

Since it is not helpful to have this new information obscure key audio information in the original sound track (or be obscured by loud sound effects), the new information is added during pauses in dialogue and sound effects. This limits the amount of supplementary information that can be added to the program.

      

The soundtrack with the audio description (of visual information) can either be an alternate sound track that the user can choose, or it can be the standard sound track that everyone hears.

#### Examples
- A travelogue of the northeast has additional audio description added during the gaps in the dialogue to let listeners who are blind know what the person is talking about at any point in time.
- A video shows a woodpecker carving a nest in a tree. A button within the content allows users to turn the audio description track on or off.
- A lecture has audio description added whenever the instructor says things like "and
                *this*
                is the one that is most important." The audio descriptions lets listeners who can not see the video know what "this" is.
- A movie file has two audio tracks, one of which includes audio description. Users can choose either one when listening to the movie by selecting the appropriate track in their media player.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that the ability exists to turn on the audio track that includes audio descriptions. For example, by using a control within the content itself or by selecting a control or preference in the media player or operating system.
2. Listen to the synchronized media
3. Check to see if gaps in dialogue are used to convey important information regarding visual content

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #3 are true.

### G80: Providing a submit button to initiate a change of context <a id="g80"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism that allows users
            to explicitly request changes of context. Since the intended use of a submit
            button is to generate an HTTP request that submits data entered in a form,
            this is an appropriate control to use for causing a change of context and is
            a practice that does not create confusion for users.

#### Examples
Example 1: A submit button is used for each form that causes a
                change in context.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Find all forms in the content
2. For each form, check that it has a submit button

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 is true

### G82: Providing a text alternative that identifies the purpose of interactive non-text content <a id="g82"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide useful information via the text
            alternative even if the full function of the non-text content cannot be
            provided.

      

Sometimes, a text alternative cannot serve the same purpose as the original
            interactive non-text content (for example an applet meant to develop two dimensional
            rapid targeting skills and eye hand coordination). In these cases this
            technique is used. With this technique a description of the purpose of the
            non-text content is provided.

#### Examples
- An eye-hand coordination development applet has the
                    following text alternative "Applet that uses the mouse and
                    moving targets to develop eye-hand coordination"
- A camera applet that has a round disk where you push on the
                    edges to control a remote camera and a slider in the middle
                    for zooming has the following text alternative "Control for
                    aiming and zooming remote video camera".

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Remove, hide, or mask the non-text content.
2. Replace it with the text alternative.
3. Check that the purpose of the non-text content is clear - even
                  if function is lost.

### G83: Providing text descriptions to identify required fields that were not completed <a id="g83"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to notify the user when a field that must be completed has not been completed. When users fail to provide input for any mandatory form fields, information is provided in text to enable the users to identify which fields were omitted. One approach is to use client-side validation and provide an alert dialog box identifying the mandatory fields which were omitted. Another approach, using server-side validation, is to re-display the form (including any  previously entered data), with either a text description at the location of the omitted mandatory field, or a text description that identifies the omitted mandatory fields.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> The best practice is to include a message or alert, as some users may not be aware that an error has occurred and could assume that the form is not functioning correctly. It is also best practice to include an error notification in the page title (`title` element) since a screen reader user is likely to believe the page was submitted correctly and continue to navigate to another page as soon as the new page is returned instead of reading the main content area of the page again.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
- A user attempts to submit a form but has neglected to provide input or select a choice in one or more mandatory fields. Using client-side validation, the omission is detected and an alert dialog appears informing the user that mandatory fields have not been completed. The labels of the fields with this problem are changed to identify the problem field, and links to the problem fields are inserted in the document after the submit button so the user can move to them after dismissing the alert.
- A user attempts to submit a form but has neglected to provide input or select a choice in one or more mandatory fields. Using server-side validation, the omission is detected and the form is re-displayed with a text description at the top informing which mandatory fields were omitted. Each omitted mandatory field is also identified using a text label so that the user does not have to return to the list at the top of the form to find the omitted fields.
- A user is completing a form that contains mandatory fields.  The labels of the fields indicate whether or not they are mandatory.  The user tabs to a mandatory field, and tabs out of the field without entering any data or selecting a choice.  A client-side script modifies the label of the field to indicate that leaving it blank was an error.

            

> **Note:**
> >                
> 
> Some screen readers may not notice and announce the change to the label so screen reader users may be unaware of the error.
> 
> 
>

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Fill out a form, deliberately leaving one or more required (mandatory) fields blank, and submit it.
2. Check that a text description is provided identifying the mandatory field(s) that was not completed.
3. Check that other data previously entered by the user is re-displayed, unless the data is in a security related field where it would be inappropriate to retain the data for re-display (e.g. password).

### G84: Providing a text description when the user provides information that is not in the list of allowed values <a id="g84"></a>

#### Description
When users enter input that is validated, and errors are detected, the nature of the error needs to be described to the user in manner they can access. One approach is to present an alert dialog that describes fields with errors when the user attempts to submit the form. Another approach, if validation is done by the server, is to return the form (with the user's data still in the fields) and a text description at the top of the page that indicates the fact that there was a validation problem, describes the nature of the problem, and provides ways to locate the field(s) with a problem easily. The "in text" portion of the success criterion underscores that it is not sufficient simply to indicate that a field has an error by putting an asterisk on its label or turning the label red. A text description of the problem should be provided.

      

When input must be one of a set of allowed values, the text description should indicate this fact. It should include the list of values if possible, or suggest the allowed value that is most similar to the entered value.

#### Examples
- The user inputs invalid data on a form field. Before the user submits the form, an alert dialog appears that describes the nature of the error so the user can fix it.
- The user inputs invalid data on a form field and submits the form. The server returns the form, with the user's data still present, and indicates clearly in text at the top of the page that there were input errors. The text describes the nature of the error(s) and clearly indicates which field had the problem so the user can easily navigate to it to fix the problem.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Enter invalid data in a form field.
2. Check that information is provided in text about the problem.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 is true.

### G85: Providing a text description when user input falls outside the required format or values <a id="g85"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide assistance in correcting input errors where the information supplied by the user is not accepted. When users enter data input that is validated, and input errors are detected, information about the nature and location of the input error is provided in text to enable the users to identify the problem. One approach is to use client-side validation and provide an alert dialog box that describes the error immediately when users enter invalid data in field. Another approach, using server-side validation, is to re-display the form (including any previously entered data), and a text description at the top of the page that indicates the fact that there was an error, describes the nature of the problem, and provides ways to easily locate the field(s) with a problem.

      

However the text description is provided, it should do one of the following things to assist the user:

      

- Provide examples of the correct data entry for the field,
- Describe the correct data entry for the field,
- Show values of the correct data entry that are similar to the user's data entry, with instructions to the user as to how to enter one of these correct values should the user choose to do so.

#### Examples
- The user inputs invalid data on a form field. When the user exits the field, an alert dialog appears that describes the nature of the error so the user can fix it.
- The user inputs invalid data on a form field and submits the form. The server returns the form, with the user's data still present, and indicates clearly in text at the top of the page that there were input errors. The text describes the nature of the error(s) and clearly indicates which field had the problem so the user can easily navigate to it to fix the problem.
- The user inputs invalid data on a form field and attempts to submit the form. Client side scripting detects the error, cancels the submit, and modifies the document to provide a text description after the submit button describing the error, with links to the field(s) with the error. The script also modifies the labels of the fields with the problems to highlight them.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Fill out a form, deliberately enter user input that falls outside the required format or values
2. Check that a text description is provided that identifies the field in error and provides some information about the nature of the invalid entry and how to fix it.
3. Check that other data previously entered by the user is re-displayed, unless the data is in a security related field where it would be inappropriate to retain the data for re-display (e.g. password).

### G87: Providing closed captions <a id="g87"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a way for people who have
            hearing impairments or otherwise have trouble hearing the dialogue in
            synchronized media material to be able to view the material and see the dialogue and
            sounds - without requiring people who are not deaf to watch the captions.
            With this technique all of the dialogue and important sounds are embedded as
            text in the same [human language]() as the video, in a fashion that causes the text not to be visible unless the user
            requests it. As a result they are visible only when needed. This requires
            special support for captioning in the user agent.

      

NOTE: Captions should not be confused with subtitles. Subtitles provide text
            of only the dialogue, in a different [human language](), and do not include important sounds.

#### Examples
In order to ensure that users who are deaf can use their
                interactive educational materials, the college provides captions and
                instructions for turning on captions for all of their audio
                interactive educational programs.

         
      

      

         
            

The online movies at a media outlet all include
                captions and are provided in a format that allows embedding of
                closed captions.

         
      

      

         
            

Special caption files including synchronization
                information are provided for an existing movie. Players are
                available that can play the captions in a separate window on screen,
                synchronized with the movie window.

         
      

      

         
            

A video of a local news event has captions provided that
                can be played over the video or in a separate window depending on
                the player used.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Turn on the closed caption feature of the media player
2. View the synchronized media content
3. Check that captions (of all dialogue and important sounds) are
                  visible and in the [human language]() of the video

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #3 is true

### G88: Providing descriptive titles for web pages <a id="g88"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to give each web page a descriptive title. Descriptive titles help users find content, orient themselves within it, and navigate through it. A descriptive title allows a user to easily identify what web page they are using and to tell when the web page has changed. The title can be used to identify the web page without requiring users to read or interpret page content. Users can more quickly identify the content they need when accurate, descriptive titles appear in site maps or lists of search results. When descriptive titles are used within link text, they help users navigate more precisely to the content they are interested in.

      

The title of each web page  should:

      

- Identify the subject of the web page
- Make sense when read out of context, for example by a screen reader or in a site map or list of search results
- Be short

      

It may also be helpful for the title to

      

- Identify the site or other resource to which the web page belongs
- Be unique within the site or other resource to which the web page belongs

#### Examples
##### A title that lists the most important identifying information first

         
            

A web page is published by a group within a larger organization. The title of the web page first identifies the topic of the page, then shows the group name followed by the name of the parent organization.

         

```html
<title>Working with us: The Small Group: The Big Organization</title>
```

      

      

         

##### A synchronized media presentation with a descriptive title

				 

A synchronized media presentation about the 2004 South Asian tsunami is titled "The Tsunami of 2004."

      

      

         

##### A web page with a descriptive title in three parts

				 

A web page provides guidelines and suggestions for creating closed captions. The web page is part of a "sub-site" within a larger site. The title is separated into three parts by dashes. The first part of the title identifies the organization. The second part identifies the sub-site to which the web page belongs. The third part identifies the web page itself.

```html
<title>Computer Hardware Corporation - Laptop Division - Laptop FAQs</title>
```

      

      

				

##### A newspaper web page

				

A website that only permits viewing of the current edition titles its web page "National News, Front Page". A website that permits editions from different dates to be viewed titles its web page, "National News, Front Page, Oct 17, 2005".

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

1. Check that the web page has a title
2. Check that the title is relevant to the content of the web page.
3. Check that the web page can be identified using the title.

      

      

				

##### Expected Results

         

- All checks above are true.

### G90: Providing keyboard-triggered event handlers <a id="g90"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to permit individuals who rely on a keyboard or keyboard interface to access the functionality of the content. To do this, make sure that all event handlers triggered by non-keyboard UI events are also associated with a keyboard-based event, or provide redundant keyboard-based mechanisms to accomplish the functionality provided by other device-specific functions.

#### Examples
- **Example 1: A drag and drop feature**
                A photo application includes a "drag" and "drop" feature to allow users to re-order photographs in an on-line album for presentation as a slide show. It also includes a feature that allows users to select a photo and 'cut' and 'paste' the items into the list at the appropriate point using only the keyboard.
- **Example 2: A reorder feature**
                A web application that allows users to create surveys by dragging questions into position includes a list of the questions followed by a text field that allows users to re-order questions as needed by entering the desired question number.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. check that all functionality can be accessed using only the keyboard

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #1 is true

### G91: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link <a id="g91"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to describe the purpose of a link in the text of the link. The description lets a user distinguish this link from links in the web page that lead to other destinations and helps the user determine whether to follow the link. The URI of the destination is generally not sufficiently descriptive.

#### Examples
##### Describing the purpose of a link in HTML in the text content of the a element

```html
<a href="routes.html">Current routes at Boulders Climbing Gym</a>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

For each link in the content that uses this technique:

			

1. Check that text of the link describes the purpose of the link

		

		

			

##### Expected Results

			

- Check #1 is true.

### G92: Providing long description for non-text content that serves the same
          purpose and presents the same information <a id="g92"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a long text alternative that
            serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the original
            non-text content when a short text alternative is not sufficient.

      

Combined with the short text alternative, the long description should be
            able to substitute for the non-text content. The short alternative
            identifies the non-text content; the long alternative provides the
            information. If the non-text content were removed from the page and
            substituted with the short and long descriptions, the page would still
            provide the same function and information.

      

In deciding what should be in the text alternatives, the following questions
            are helpful.

      

- Why is this non-text content here?
- What information is it presenting?
- What purpose does it fulfill?
- If I could not use the non-text content, what words would I use to
                convey the same function and/or information?

#### Examples
A chart showing sales for October has a short text
                alternative of "October sales chart". The long description would
                read "Bar Chart showing sales for October. There are 6 salespersons.
                Maria is highest with 349 units. Frances is next with 301. Then
                comes Juan with 256, Sue with 250, Li with 200 and Max with 195. The
                primary use of the chart is to show leaders, so the description is
                in sales order."

         
      

      

         
            

A line graph that shows average winter temperatures from
                the past 10 years includes a short text alternative of "Average
                winter temperatures 1996-2006." The long description includes the
                data table that was used to generate the line graph.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Remove, hide, or mask the non-text content
2. Display the long description
3. Check that the long description conveys the same information
                  conveyed by the non-text content.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #3 is true.

### G93: Providing open (always visible) captions <a id="g93"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a way for people who are deaf or otherwise have trouble hearing the dialogue in audio visual material to be able to view the material in the same [human language]().  With this technique all of the dialogue and important sounds are embedded as text in the video track.  As a result they are always visible and no special support for captioning is required by the user agent.

      

NOTE: Captions should not be confused with subtitles. Subtitles provide text of only the dialogue, in a different [human language](), and do not include important sounds.

#### Examples
- In order to ensure that everyone can view their online movies, even if users do not know how to turn on captions in their media player, a library association puts the captions directly into the video.
- A news organization provides open captions on all of its material.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Watch the synchronized media with closed captioning turned off.
2. Check that captions (of all dialogue and important sounds) are visible.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 is true

### G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content <a id="g94"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to create a text alternative that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the original non-text content.  As a result, it is possible to remove the non-text content and replace it with the text alternative and no functionality or information would be lost.   This text alternative should not necessarily describe the non-text content.  It should serve the same purpose and convey the same information.  This may sometimes result in a text alternative that looks like a description of the non-text content.  But this would only be true if that was the best way to serve the same purpose.

      

If possible, the short text alternative should completely convey the purpose and information.  If it is not possible to do this in a short phrase or sentence, then the short text alternative should provide a brief overview of the information.  A long text alternative would be used in addition to convey the full information.

      

The text alternative should be able to substitute for the non-text content. If the non-text content were removed from the page and substituted with the text, the page would still provide the same function and information. The text alternative would be brief but as informative as possible.

      

In deciding what text to include in the alternative, it is often a good idea to consider the following questions:

      

- Why is this non-text content here?
- What information is it presenting?
- What purpose does it fulfill?
- If I could not use the non-text content, what words would I use to convey the same function and/or information?

      

When non-text content contains words that are important to understanding the content, the alt text should include those words. If the text in the image is more than can fit in a short text alternative then it should be described in the short text alternative and a long text alternative should be provided as well with the complete text.

#### Examples
- A search button uses an image of a magnifying glass.  The text alternative is "search" and not "magnifying glass".
- A picture shows how a knot is tied including arrows showing how the ropes go to make the knot.  The text alternative describes how to tie the knot, not what the picture looks like.
- A picture shows what a toy looks like from the front.  The text alternative describes a front view of the toy.
- An animation shows how to change a tire. A short text alternative describes what the animation is about. A long text alternative describes how to change a tire.
- A logo of the TechTron company appears next to each product in a list that is made by that and has a short text alternative that reads, "TechTron."
- A chart showing sales for October has an short text alternative of  "October sales chart". It also has a long description that provides all of the information on the chart.
- A heading contains a picture of the words, "The History of War" in stylized text. The alt text for the picture is "The History of War".
- An image of a series of books on a shelf contains interactive areas
                that provide the navigation means to a web page about the particular book. The
                text alternative "The books available to buy in this section. Select a book for
                more details about that book." describes the picture and the interactive
                nature.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Remove, hide, or mask the non-text content
2. Replace it with the text alternative
3. Check that nothing is lost (the purpose of the non-text content is met by the text alternative)
4. If the non-text content contains words that are important to understanding the content, the words are included in the text alternative

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #3 is true. If the non-text content contains words that are important to understanding the content, check #4 is also true

### G95: Providing short text alternatives that provide a brief description of
          the non-text content <a id="g95"></a>

#### Description
This technique is used when the text needed to serve the same purpose and
            present the same information as the original non-text content is too lengthy
            or when this goal cannot be achieved with text alone. In that case this
            technique is used to provide a short text alternative that briefly describes
            the non-text content. (A long text alternative is then provided using
            another technique such that the combination serves the same purpose and
            presents the same information as the original non-text content.)

      

In deciding what text to include in the alternative, it is often a good idea
            to consider the following questions:

      

- Why is this non-text content here?
- What information is it presenting?
- What purpose does it fulfill?
- If I could not use the non-text content, what words would I use to
                convey the same function and/or information?

#### Examples
- A chart showing sales for October has an short text
                alternative of "October sales chart". It also has a long
                description that provides all of the information on the
                chart.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check for the presence of a short text alternative that provides
                  a brief description of the non-text content.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #1 is true.

### G96: Providing textual identification of items that otherwise rely only on sensory information to be understood <a id="g96"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that items within a web page are referenced in the content not only by shape, size, sound or location, but also in ways that do not depend on that sensory perception. For example, a reference may also describe the function of the item or its label.

#### Examples
##### Button referenced by shape and accessible name

			

A round button is provided on a form to submit the form and move onto the next step in a progression. The button is labeled with the text "go". The instructions state, "to submit the form press the round button labeled *go*". This includes both shape and textual information to locate the button.

		

		

         

##### A section of navigation links referenced by location and heading

			

Instructions for a web page providing on-line training state, "Use the list of links to the right with the heading, 'Class Listing' to navigate to the desired on-line course."  This description provides location as well as textual clues to help find the correct list of links.

		

		

         

##### Button referenced by position and accessible name

			

The following layout places a button in the lower right corner and indicates it by position. An indication of the text label clarifies which button to use for users for which the position is not meaningful.

			

				

###### The HTML

```html
<form class="wrapper">
  <h1>Sign up to our mailing list</h1>
    <div role="note">
      Complete the form and then press the lower-right (<i>sign up</i>) button.
    </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="full-name">Your name</label>
    <input autocomplete="name" id="full-name" type="text">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">Your email address</label>
    <input autocomplete="email" id="email" type="text">
  </div>
  <button type="reset">Cancel</button>
  <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
</form>
```

			

			

				

###### The CSS

```css
.wrapper{
  border:1px solid #aeaeae;
  display:grid;
  gap:1rem;
  grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;
  padding:1rem;
  width:50vw;
 }
 
 label{
  display:block;
 }
 
 input, button{
  font:inherit;
 }
 
 h1, [role=note]{
  grid-column:1 / -1;
 }
 
 .form-group{
  grid-column:1;
 }
 
 input{
  width:100%;
 }
 
 button[type=reset]{
  grid-column:1;
 }
 
 button[type=submit]{
  grid-column:2;
 }
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

Find all references in the web page that mention the shape, size, or position of an object.  For each such item:

			

1. Check that the reference contains additional information that allows the item to be located and identified without any knowledge of its shape, size, or relative position.

		

		

			

##### Expected Results

			

- Check #1 is true.

### G98: Providing the ability for the user to review and correct answers before submitting <a id="g98"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide users with a way to ensure their input is correct before completing an irreversible transaction. Testing, financial, and legal applications permit transactions to occur which cannot be "undone". It is therefore important that there be no errors in the data submission, as the user will not have the opportunity to correct the error once the transaction has been committed.

      

On a simple, 1-page form this is easy because the user can review the form before submitting. On a form that spans multiple web pages, however, data is collected from the user in multiple steps before the transaction is committed. The user may not recall all of the data that was entered in previous steps before the step which commits the transaction.

      

One approach is to cache the results of each individual step and allow the user to navigate back and forth at will to review all data entered. Another approach is to provide a summary of all data collected in all steps for the user to review prior to the final commitment of the transaction.

      

Before the final step that commits the transaction to occur, instructions are provided to prompt the user to review the data entered and confirm. Once the user confirms, the transaction is completed.

#### Examples
- An online banking application provides multiple steps to complete a transfer of funds between accounts as follows:

            

1. Select "transfer from" account
2. Select "transfer to" account
3. Enter transfer amount

            

A summary of the transaction is provided showing the from and to accounts and the transfer amount. The user can select a button to either complete the transaction or cancel it.
- A testing application provides multiple pages of questions. At any time, the user can choose to return to previously completed sections to review and change answers. A final page is displayed providing buttons to either submit the test answers or review answers.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

In a testing application or one that causes financial or legal transactions to occur and that also collects data from users in multiple steps:

         

1. Check that the user is prompted to review and confirm data.
2. If user data are collected in multiple steps, the user is allowed to return to previous steps to review and change data.
3. Determine if a summary of all data input by the user is provided before the transaction is committed and a method is provided to correct errors if necessary.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Either #2 or #3 is true.

### G99: Providing the ability to recover deleted information <a id="g99"></a>

#### Description
When a web application provides the capability of deleting information, the server can provide a means to recover information that was deleted in error by a user. One approach is to delay deleting the data by merely marking it for deletion or moving it to a holding area (such as a trash can) and waiting some period of time before actually deleting it. During this time period, the user can request that the data be restored or can retrieve it from the holding area. Another approach is to record all delete transactions in such a way that data can be restored if requested by the user, such as in the edit history stored by wikis and source control applications.The retrievable information that is stored should be that which would be needed to correct the transaction.

#### Examples
- A web application allows users to set up folders and store data within them. Each folder and data item is accompanied by a checkbox to mark it for action, and two buttons, one to move and one to delete. If the user selects the delete button by mistake, large amounts of data could be lost. The application presents the data as deleted to the user right away, but schedules it for actual deletion in one week. During the week, the user may go into a "deleted items" folder and request any folder or data item awaiting actual deletion to be restored.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Identify functionality that allows deleting content
2. Delete content and attempt to recover it.
3. Check if deleted information can be recovered.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #3 is true.

### G100: Providing a short text alternative which is the accepted name or a descriptive name of the non-text content <a id="g100"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow users to identify the non-text
            content even if the non-text content is intended to provide a specific
            sensory experience. For example, a deaf person may want to know what an
            audio instrumental file is - even if they cannot hear it. Similarly, a blind
            person may want to know what the subject of a visual image is - even if they
            cannot see it.

#### Examples
- A painting of the Mona Lisa has an alternate text of "Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci".
- A sound file has an alternate text of "5 Grade children playing a Theremin".
- A famous modern art piece is labeled "Red, Blue and Yellow, by Piet Mondrian".

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that short text alternative provides a descriptive name.
2. Check that short text alternative provides a name that has be previously been given to the non-text content by the author or another.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #1 or #2 is true

#### Related Techniques

### G107: Using "activate" rather than "focus" as a trigger for changes of context <a id="g107"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a method for activating things that is predictable by the user. Users with cognitive disabilities and people using screen readers or screen magnifiers may be confused by an unexpected event such as automatic form submission or activation of a function that causes a change of context.

      

With this technique, all changes of context would be triggered only by a specific action on the part of the user.  Further, that action would be one that usually causes changes in context, such as clicking on a link or pressing a submit button.  Actions that simply move the focus to an element would not cause a change of context.

#### Examples
- A page pops up a new window only when the user clicks(or uses spacebar) on a button rather than using onfocus to pop up a new window.
- A submit button is used to move on to the next data entry screen rather than having the next screen appear automatically when the user tabbed onto a 'done' button.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Using a keyboard, cycle focus through all content
2. Check that no changes of context occur when any component receives focus.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 is true

### G108: Using markup features to expose the name and role, allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide notification of changes <a id="g108"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow assistive technology to
            understand web content so that it can convey equivalent information to the
            user through an alternate user interface and allow them to operate controls
            through the AT.

      

This technique involves using standard, documented and supported features to
            expose these properties to AT. It relies on the fact that these standard
            controls in standard browsers meet the requirements.

      

For HTML these assumptions are good. They may also be appropriate for some
            other technologies.

      

Even when the components support accessibility, it is essential that some
            information be provided by the author. For example, a control may have the
            ability to provide a name but the author still has to provide the name. The
            role attribute however may already be provided since it is a standard
            component with a fixed role.

#### Examples
Example 1: A web page written in HTML uses standard form
                controls, and identifies the form control using the title attribute.
                The user agent makes information about these controls, including the
                name, available to assistive technology through the DOM and through
                a platform-specific Accessibility API.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Visually inspect the markup or use a tool.
2. Check that proper markup is used such that the name and role,
                  for each user interface component can be determined.
3. Check that proper markup is used such that the user interface
                  components that accept user input can all be operated from AT.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Step #2 and #3 are both true for each user interface component

### G111: Using color and pattern <a id="g111"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that when color differences are used to convey information within non-text content, patterns are included to convey the same information in a manner that does not depend on color.

#### Examples
A real estate site provides a bar chart of average housing prices in several regions of the United States. The bar for each region is displayed with a different solid color and a different pattern. The legend uses the same colors and patterns to identify each bar.

         
      

      

         
            

An on-line map of a transportation system displays each route in a different color. The stops on each route are marked with a distinctive icon such as a diamond, square, or circle to help differentiate each route.

         
      

      

         
            

A flow chart describes a set of iterative steps to complete a process. It uses dashed, arrowed lines with a green background to point to the next step in the process when the specified condition passes. It uses dotted arrowed lines with a red background to point to the next step in the process when the specified condition fails.

         
      

      

         
            

The content includes an interactive game. The game pieces for the 4 players are distinguished from one another using both color and pattern.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each image within the web page that use color differences to convey information:

         

1. Check that all information that is conveyed using color is also conveyed using patterns that do not rely on color.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #1 is true.

### G115: Using semantic elements to mark up structure <a id="g115"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to mark up the structure of the web content using the appropriate semantic elements. In other words, the elements are used according to their meaning, not because of the way they appear visually.

		

Using the appropriate semantic elements will make sure the structure is available to the user agent. This involves explicitly indicating the role that different units have in understanding the meaning of the content. The nature of a piece of content as a paragraph, header, emphasized text, table, etc. can all be indicated in this way. In some cases, the relationships between units of content should also be indicated, such as between headings and subheadings, or amongst the cells of a table. The user agent can then make the structure perceivable to the user, for example using a different visual presentation for different types of structures or by using a different voice or pitch in an auditory presentation.

		

In HTML, for example, phrase-level elements such as `em`, `abbr`, and `cite` add semantic information within sentences, marking text for emphasis and identifying abbreviations and citations, respectively. MathML, a markup language designed to maintain important distinctions between structure and presentation in mathematics, includes special "presentation" markup for the complex notations used to represent mathematical ideas as well as "content" (semantic) markup for the mathematical ideas themselves.

#### Examples
##### Linking to another page

			

A paragraph contains a hyperlink to another page. The hyperlink is marked up using the `a` element.

   

```html
<p>Do you want to try our new tool yourself? A free demonstration
  version is available in our <a href="download.html">download section</a>
</p>
```

      

      

				

##### Using cite and blockquote to reference a book and a quotation from it

				

A page about the history of marriage uses a quotation from Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice, as an example. The reference to the book is marked up using the `cite` element and the quotation itself is marked up using the `blockquote` element.

```html
<p>Marriage was considered a logical step for a bachelor, as can be seen in the
   first chapter of the novel <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in
   possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
  <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may
   be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well
   fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered
   the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
</blockquote>
```

      

      

				

##### Using the strong element to emphasize important text

				

A car manual explains how to start the engine. The instructions include a warning to make sure the gear is in neutral. The author feels the warning is so important that it should be emphasized so the warning is marked up using the `strong` element.

 

```html
<h1>How to start the engine</h1>
<p>Before starting the engine, <strong>make sure the gear is in neutral</strong>
   Next, turn the key in the ignition. The engine should start.</p>
```

      

      

				

##### Using the em and strong elements to emphasize text

         

```html
<p>What the user <em>really</em> meant to say was, 
   <q>This is not ok, it is <strong>excellent</strong>!</q>
</p>
```

      

      

         

##### Using highlighting and background color to visually and semantically identify important information

```html
<style>
.vocab {
  background-color:cyan;
  font-style:normal;
}
</style>
...
<p>New vocabulary words are emphasized and highlighted with a cyan background.</p>
<p>The <em class="vocab">scathing</em> review of the play seemed a bit too harsh.</p>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check if there are parts of the content that have a semantic function.
2. For each part that has a semantic function, if corresponding semantic markup exists in the technology, check that the content has been marked up using that semantic markup.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #2 is true.

### G117: Using text to convey information that is conveyed by variations in presentation of text <a id="g117"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that information conveyed through variations in the formatting of text is conveyed in text as well. When the visual appearance of text is varied to convey information, state the information explicitly in the text. Variations in the visual appearance can be made by changes in font face, font size, underline, strike through and various other text attributes. When these types of variations convey information, that information needs to be available elsewhere in the content via text. Including additional sections in the document or an inline description where the variation in presentation of text occurs can be used to convey the information.

#### Examples
##### Indicating new content with boldface and a text indicator

				 

The following example shows a list of accessibility standards. WCAG 2.2 is new, so is indicated in bold face. To avoid conveying information solely by presentation, the word "(new)" is included after it as well.

         

```html
<h2>Web Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>WCAG 2.2 (New)</strong></li>
  <li>WCAG 2.1</li>
  <li>WCAG 2.0</li>
  <li>Section 508</li>
  <li>JIS X 8341-3</li>
  ...
</ul>
```

      

      

         

##### Font variations and explicit statements.

         
            

An online document has gone through multiple drafts. Insertions are underlined and deletions are struck through. At the end of the draft a "change history" lists all changes made to each draft.

         
      

      

         

##### Providing an alternate way to know which words in the text have been identified by using a different font.

				 

An on-line test requires students to write a short summary of a longer document. The summary must contain certain words from the original document. When a sentence in the original document contains a word or phrase that must be used in the summary, the word or phrase is shown in a different font than the rest of the sentence. A separate section also lists all the words and phrases that must be used in the summary.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

1. Find items where variations in presentation of text are used to convey information.
2. For those items, check to determine if information conveyed visually is also stated explicitly in text.

		

		

			

##### Expected Results

			

- Check #2 is true.

### G130: Providing descriptive headings <a id="g130"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to make section headings within web content descriptive. Descriptive headings and titles (see [Providing descriptive titles for web pages](../general/G88)) work together to give users an overview of the content and its organization. Descriptive headings identify sections of the content in relation both to the web page as a whole and to other sections of the same web page.

      

Descriptive headings help users find specific content and orient themselves within the web page.

      

Authors may also want to consider putting the most important information at the beginning of each heading. This helps users "skim" the headings to locate the specific content they need, and is especially helpful when browsers or assistive technology allow navigation from heading to heading.

#### Examples
##### An HTML page that describes the range of tasks for disaster preparation

```html
<h1>Disaster preparation</h1>
<h2>Flood preparation</h2>
<h2>Fire preparation</h2>
```

         
            

Note that the level 2 headings have the distinguishing information at the beginning (i.e., instead of "Preparation for floods", "Preparation for fires", etc).

         
      

      

         

##### An article

         

A short article about the history of a town that explains about the founding and expansion of the town and then goes into some depth about the current situation. The title of the web page is "History of Ourtown". The first section is called "The founding of Ourtown". The second section is called "Expansion of Ourtown". The third section is called "Ourtown today" which has the following subsections: "People in Ourtown", "Organizations in Ourtown" and "Buildings in Ourtown".

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Determine if the web page contains headings.
2. Check that each heading identifies its section of the content.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #2 is true.

### G131: Providing descriptive labels <a id="g131"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that the label for any interactive component within web content makes the component's purpose clear. Using the appropriate technology-specific techniques for technologies for associating labels with interactive controls allows assistive technology to recognize the label and present it to the user, therefore allowing the user to identify the purpose of the control.The label may also be used to include text or a text symbol indicating that input is required.

#### Examples
##### Online maps with controls for zooming in and out

         
            

A web application presents maps of a city. Users can “zoom in" to view part of the map in greater detail, and can “zoom out" to make it show a larger part of the city. The controls can be operated using either a mouse or a keyboard. The controls are labeled “Zoom in (Ctrl + Shift + L)" And “Zoom out (Ctrl + Shift + R)."

         
      

      

         

##### A form asking the name of the user

         
            

A form asks the name of the user. It consists of two input fields to ask for the first and last name. The first field is labeled "First name", the second is labeled "Last name".

         
      

      

         

##### A form with required fields

         
            

A purchasing form includes several fields that are required. In addition to identifying the field, the label for each required field includes the word “required" in parentheses.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each interface component with a label:

         

1. Identify the purpose of the interface component.
2. Check that each label makes the component's purpose clear.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #2 is true.

### G133: Providing a checkbox on the first page of a multipart form that allows users to ask for longer session time limit or no session time limit <a id="g133"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to minimize the risk that users with disabilities will lose their work by providing a checkbox to request additional time to complete multipart forms. The checkbox can allow the user to request a specific amount of additional time (for example 15 minutes) or an indefinite extension. (Note that allowing an indefinite extension would be inappropriate if it jeopardized user privacy or network security.)

#### Examples
##### A checkbox for requesting a specific extension

         
            

A web page contains the first part of a five-part form. Immediately following the general instructions for completing the form is a checkbox with the label, “Allow an additional 15 minutes to complete each part of this form."

         
      

      

         

##### Requesting an indefinite extension

         
            

A web page contains the first part of a three-part form. Each part of the form includes more than 10 items. Some items require users to follow links for additional information. Immediately following the general instructions for completing the form is a checkbox with the label, “Allow as much time as I need to complete this form. I understand that I must close (quit) the web browser if I choose to stop before completing the last part of the form."

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

If the web page contains the first part of a multipart form:

         

1. Check that the web page includes a checkbox to request additional time to complete the form.
2. Check that if the checkbox is checked, additional time is provided to complete the form.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

1. All checks are true.

### G135: Using the accessibility API features of a technology to expose names and
          roles, to allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and to provide
          notification of changes <a id="g135"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow assistive technology to
            understand web content so that it can convey equivalent information to the
            user through an alternate user interface.

      

Sometimes content is not created using markup language but rather using a
            programming language or tools. In many cases, these technologies have
            interface components that are already programmed to interface with
            accessibility APIs. If an author uses these components and fills in the
            properties (e.g., name, etc) the resulting user interface components in the
            content will be accessible to assistive technology.

#### Examples
- A web page uses java to create an applet. Java swing objects
                    (e.g., pushbutton) are used because they have accessibility
                    properties built in that can be accessed from assistive
                    technology written in Java and, with the Java Access Bridge,
                    those written in other languages that use the Accessibility
                    API of the operating system. The author fills in the values
                    for the components and the result is accessible to AT.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Render content using an accessible User Agent
2. Use an Accessibility Tool designed for the Accessibility API of
                  the User agent to evaluate each user interface component
3. Check that name and role for each user interface component are
                  found by the tool.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Step #3 is true for each user interface component

---

### G140: Separating information and structure from presentation to enable different presentations <a id="g140"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to facilitate the interaction of assistive technology with content by logically separating the content's structural encoding from the presentational encoding. Structural encoding is the indication of elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, etc., and is done by using technology features reserved for the purpose. By contrast, presentational encoding is the indication of formatting effects, such as typeface, color, size, position, borders, etc., and is also supported by technology features.

      

While presentational features visually imply structure — users can determine headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. from the formatting conventions used — these features do not encode the structure unambiguously enough for assistive technology to interact with the page effectively. Providing separate structure, functionality, and presentation layers allows the semantics implied by the formatting to become programmatically determined via the structure layer.

      

Following this technique allows user agents to:

      
      

- Perform meaningful structure transformations based on the existing structure of the content, such as reordering sections or generating a list of sections or a list of links.
- Support interaction with content based on structural characteristics that cannot be determined by assistive technology on the basis of presentational information alone. For instance, it may be desirable to provide special interactions with lists by indicating the number of list items or skipping to the end, but this is only possible if the list structure is encoded in addition to the list presentation.
- Modify the presentation of content by substituting alternate presentation rules attached to structural features.

#### Examples
##### HTML with CSS

         
            

An HTML document uses the structural features of HTML, such as paragraphs, lists, headings, etc., and avoids presentational features such as font changes, layout hints, etc. CSS is used to format the document based on its structural properties. Well-crafted "class" attributes in the HTML extend the semantics of the structural markup if needed to allow more flexible formatting with CSS. Assistive technologies can substitute or extend the CSS to modify presentation, or ignore the CSS and interact directly with the structural encoding.

         
      

      

         

##### Tagged PDF

         
            

A PDF document consists mostly of the content embedded with formatting information. Information about the structure is provided in a separate section of the document using XML-like tags; this is called "tagged PDF". The information in these tags can be used by assistive technologies to perform meaningful structure transformations (e.g., generating a list of sections) or to support interaction with content based on structural characteristics (e.g., jumping to the start of forms).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Examine the encoding of a document.
2. Check that structural information and functionality are explicitly provided and is logically separated from presentational information.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #2 is true

### G142: Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support zoom <a id="g142"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure content can be scaled uniformly by using a web technology supported by user agents that change text size via a Zoom tool.

      

Content authored in technologies that are supported by user agents that can scale content uniformly (that is, zoom into content) satisfy this success criterion. Because this technique relies completely on user agent functionality, it is critical to test with a wide variety of user agents.

      

This technique requires that the zoom function preserve all spatial relationships on the page and that all functionality continues to be available.

#### Examples
- Most modern browsers provide a zoom function that scales HTML/CSS page content uniformly.
- To allow users to resize text, Adobe Reader provides a magnification tool that scales PDF pages uniformly.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Display content in a user agent
2. Zoom content to 200%
3. Check whether all content and functionality is available

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #3 is true.

### G143: Providing a text alternative that describes the purpose of the CAPTCHA <a id="g143"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide information via the text alternative that identifies the non-text content as a
            CAPTCHA. Such tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is presented in an obscured image or audio file. From the text alternative, the user can tell that the CAPTCHA requires completing a task and what type of task it is.

      

When an alternate version of a CAPTCHA is available, the text alternative should include instructions about how to find the alternate version.

#### Examples
- A CAPTCHA test asks the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image. The text alternative is "Type the word in the image".
- A CAPTCHA test asks the user to type in text that is played in an audio file. The text alternative is "Type the letters spoken in the audio".

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Remove, hide, or mask the CAPTCHA.
2. Replace it with the text alternative.
3. Check that the text alternative describes the purpose of the CAPTCHA.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #3 is true.

### G144: Ensuring that the web page contains another CAPTCHA serving the same purpose using a different modality <a id="g144"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to reduce occasions in which a user with a disability cannot complete a CAPTCHA task. Because there are alternate CAPTCHA tasks that use different modalities, a user is more likely to be able to complete one of the tasks successfully.

#### Examples
- A web page that includes a CAPTCHA test that must be completed successfully before the user can advance to the next step in a process. The page includes both a visual task, such as typing words displayed in a image, and an audio task, such as typing letters spoken in an audio file. A user with hearing disabilities who cannot pass the audio CAPTCHA may be able to pass the visual CAPTCHA.
- A blog comment form includes a visual CAPTCHA that must be completed before a user can submit comments. In addition to the visual CAPTCHA, it includes a CAPTCHA with a form field that asks, "What is two plus seven?" with a text entry field that allows users to enter the correct answer.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each CAPTCHA in a web page

         

1. Check that the web page contains another CAPTCHA for the same purpose but using a different modality.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #1 is true.

### G145: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 exists between text (and images of text)
          and background behind the text <a id="g145"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
            that is presented over a background. This technique relaxes the 4.5:1
            contrast ratio requirement for text that is at least 18 point (if not bold) or at least 14 point (if bold).

      

> **Note:**
> >         
> 
> When evaluating this success criterion, the font size in points should be obtained from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way that user agents do. Point sizes are based on the CSS pt size [CSS3 Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-lengths). The ratio between sizes in points and CSS pixels is 1pt = 1.333px, therefore 14pt and 18pt are equivalent to approximately 18.5px and 24px.
> 
> 
>

      

If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the
            contrast ratio of the larger-scale text can be maintained by making sure that each
            of the text letters have a 3:1 contrast ratio with the background.

      

If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned), then
            the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the
            letters maintain a 3:1 contrast ratio with the background behind them
            even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background.

      

The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the
            relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes across
            the page.

      

Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the
            necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not
            normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.

#### Examples
- A black background is chosen so that light colored letters that match the company's logo can be used.

            

Larger-scale text is placed over a picture of the college campus. Since a wide variety of colors and darknesses appear in the picture, the area behind the text is fogged white so that the picture is very faint and the maximum darkness is still light enough to maintain a 3:1 contrast ratio with the black text written over the picture.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Measure the relative luminance of each letter (unless they are all
                  uniform) using the formula:

               

- L = 0.2126 *
                      **R**

2. Measure the relative luminance of the background pixels
                  immediately next to the letter using same formula.
3. Calculate the contrast ratio using the following
                  formula.

               

- (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where

                     

- L1 is the
                          [relative luminance]()
                          of the lighter of the foreground or background colors, and
- L2 is the
                          [relative luminance]()
                          of the darker of the foreground or background colors.
4. Check that the contrast ratio is equal to or
                  greater than 3:1

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #4 is true

      

      

Before May 2021 the value of 0.04045 in the definition was different (0.03928). It was taken from an older version of the specification and has been updated. It has no practical effect on the calculations in the context of these guidelines.

### G148: Not specifying background color, not specifying text color, and not using technology features that change those defaults <a id="g148"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
            that is presented over a background. With this technique the author avoids
            having to do any contrast measures by simply not specifying the text color
            and not specifying the background. As a result the colors of both are
            completely determined by the user agent.

      

Some people who have vision disabilities set their user agent to override certain colors that they have trouble seeing. This technique will help avoid a situation where the user agent and website conflict with each other over the foreground and/or background colors resulting in the same color for text and background, which would make it invisible for user who set their own colors in their browser or Assistive Technology.

#### Examples
The author specifies neither text color nor background, and does not use CSS. As a result the user can set their browser
                defaults to provide the colors and contrasts that work well for
                them.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Look in all places that text color can be specified
2. Check that text color is not specified
3. Look in all areas that background color or image used as a background can be
                  specified
4. Check that no background color or image used as a background is specified

- # 2 and 4 are true

### G149: Using user interface components that are highlighted by the user agent when they receive focus <a id="g149"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that the focused component can be visually identified by the user by relying on user agent support. It is common for user agents to highlight standard controls in some way when they receive focus. UAAG-conformant user agents do so when they satisfy checkpoint 10.2 "Highlight selection, content focus, enabled elements, visited links". When authors use standard controls for which the user agent provides this support, users are informed of the focus location in a standard, predictable way.

#### Examples
- When html text input fields receive focus, browsers display a blinking vertical bar at the insertion point in the text field.
- When html links receive focus, they are surrounded by a dotted focus highlight rectangle.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each focusable component in the web page:

         

1. Set focus to the control
2. Check whether the user agent has highlighted the control in some way

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 is true

### G152: Setting animated gif images to stop blinking after n cycles (within 5 seconds) <a id="g152"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that animated gif images stop blinking within five seconds. There are three aspects of the design of animated gif images that work together to determine how long the image blinks (or otherwise animates):

      

- the number of
                **frames**
                in the image, which are discrete images in the animation sequence;
- the
                **frame rate**, which is how long each image is displayed;
- the number of
                **repetitions**, which is how many times the entire animation is performed;

      

At its simplest, the duration of the animation is the number of frames times the frame rate times the number of repetitions. For example, a simple blinking image with 2 frames, a frame rate of .5 seconds, and 3 repetitions will have a duration of (2 * 0.5 * 3) seconds, or exactly 3 seconds.

      

Many animated gif images have a constant frame rate, i.e., the amount of time each frame is displayed is the same. However, it is possible to set a different frame rate for each frame, to allow certain frames to be displayed longer than others. In this case, the duration of the animation is the sum of the frame rates times the number of repetitions. For example, a simple image with two frames, the first of which displays for .75 seconds and the second for .25 seconds, and three repetitions will have a duration of ((.75 + .25) * 3) seconds, also exactly 3 seconds.

      

For an image to stop blinking within 5 seconds, one of the three variables must be adjusted. Most commonly, set the number of repetitions to five seconds divided by the product of the number of frames times the frame rate (or by the sum of the frame rate). Truncate this number down to the nearest integer, do not round up to the next integer, to ensure that the image will stop within five seconds.

      

If even one repetition results in more than five seconds of animation, one of the other factors must be adjusted. Reduce the number of frames in the image, or increase the frame rate. Be careful when increasing the frame rate that the resulting image does not fail the requirement not to exceed the general flash or red flash thresholds; attention to this is especially important for large images.

#### Examples
- **A simple blinking image.**
                An image has 2 frames, a frame rate of .5 seconds, and 3 repetitions. The animation has a duration of (2 * 0.5 * 3) seconds, or exactly 3 seconds, and therefore meets the requirements of the success criterion.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Display an animated gif and time how long it animates.
2. Alternatively, use an image editor to determine the number of frames, the frame rate, and the number of repetitions. Calculate the product of the number of frames multiplied by the frame rate times the number of repetitions. If the frame rates are not uniform, calculate the product of the sum of the frame rates multiplied by the number of repetitions.
3. Using either method, the duration of animation should be less than or equal to 5 seconds.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #3 is true

### G155: Providing a checkbox in addition to a submit button <a id="g155"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a checkbox that users must select to indicate they have reviewed their input and are ready for it to be committed. This is important when the nature of the transaction is such that it may not be reversible if input errors are subsequently discovered or when the result of an action is that data is deleted. The author provides a checkbox that is not selected when the page loads, with a label like "I confirm that the input is correct and am ready to submit" or "I confirm that I wish to delete this data". The checkbox should be located near the submit button to help the user notice it during the submission process. If the checkbox is not selected when the form is submitted, the input is rejected and the user is prompted to review their entry, select the checkbox, and resubmit. Only if the checkbox is selected will the input be accepted and the transaction processed.

      

This checkbox helps to guard against the consequences of an accidental form submission, and also serves to prompt the user to be sure they have entered accurate data. This is more secure than simply putting a label on the submit button like "input is correct, submit". Providing the checkbox as a separate control from the submit button forces the user to "double-check", as they must both select the checkbox and activate the submit button for the transaction to proceed. As such, this is a mechanism for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> When users submit information without selecting the checkbox, they should not lose the information that they have entered when they return to the form to resubmit.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
- An online bank service allows users to transfer money between accounts in different currencies. Because exchange rates are constantly in flux, the money cannot be re-exchanged at the same rate if the user discovers an error in their input after the transaction has been carried out. In addition to the "account from", "account to", and "amount" fields, there is a checkbox with a label "I have checked that the amount I wish to transfer is correct". If this checkbox is not selected when the user submits the form, the transaction is not carried out and the user is notified. If the checkbox is selected, the (irreversible) transaction is carried out.
- An online payment system stores user bank account information in order to process payments. There is an elaborate procedure for users to enter new accounts and verify that they are the owner. There is the facility to delete old accounts, but if an account is accidentally deleted, it would be difficult to reinstate it, and the transaction history with that account would be lost. Therefore, on pages that allow users to delete accounts, there is a checkbox with the label "I confirm that I wish to delete this account." If this checkbox is not selected when the user submits the form, the account is not deleted and the user is given an error message. Only if the checkbox is selected is the account deleted.
- A checkout form on a shopping site includes a form that collects order, shipping and billing information. After submitting the form, the user is taken to a page where the information they have submitted is summarized for review. Below the summary, a checkbox with the label "I have reviewed and confirmed that this data is correct" is shown. The user must mark the checkbox and activate a "complete order" button in order to complete the transaction.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For user input pages that cause irreversible transactions to occur:

         

1. Check that a checkbox indicating user confirmation of the input or action is provided in addition to the submit button.
2. Check that if the checkbox is not selected when the form is submitted, the input is rejected and the user is prompted to review their entry, select the checkbox, and resubmit.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #2 are true

### G158: Providing an alternative for time-based media for audio-only content <a id="g158"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting the information in an audio-only presentation.

      

In an audio-only presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including dialogue and sounds (both natural and artificial). In order to present the same information in accessible form, this technique involves creating a document that tells the same story and presents the same information in the same [human language]() as the prerecorded audio-only content. In this technique, the document serves as long description for the content and includes all of the important dialogue and as well as descriptions of background sounds etc. that are part of the story.

      

If an actual script was used to create the audio-only content in the first place, this can be a good place to start. In production and editing however, the content often varies somewhat from the script. For this technique, the original script would be corrected to match the dialogue and what actually happens in the final edited form of the audio presentation.

#### Examples
- A podcast includes a description of new features in a recent software release. It involves two speakers informally discussing the new and updated features and describing how they are used. One of the speakers works from a list of questions that was used to outline the discussion prior to recording. After the recording is complete, the outline is then edited and supplemented to match the dialogue etc. The resulting transcript is then made available on the speakers website along with the audio-only file. The text alternative that identifies the audio only content reads, "Episode 42: Zap Version 12 (text transcript follows)" and the link to the transcript is provided immediately following the audio-only content.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. View the audio-only content while referring to the alternative for time-based media.
2. Check that the dialogue in the transcript matches the [human language](), dialogue, and information presented in the audio-only presentation.
3. If the audio includes multiple voices, check that the transcript identifies who is speaking for all dialogue.
4. Check that at least one of the following is true:

               

1. The transcript itself can be programmatically determined from the text alternative for the audio-only content
2. The transcript is referred to from the programmatically determined text alternative for the audio-only content
5. If the alternate version(s) are on a separate page, check for the availability of link(s) to allow the user to get to the other versions.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- All of the above checks are true.

### G159: Providing an alternative for time-based media for video-only content <a id="g159"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting the information in a video-only presentation.

      

In a video-only presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including animation, text or graphics, the setting and background, the actions and expressions of people, animals, etc. In order to present the same information in accessible form, this technique involves creating a document that tells the same story and presents the same information as the prerecorded video-only content. In this technique, the document serves as a long description for the content and includes all of the important information as well as descriptions of scenery, actions, expressions, etc. that are part of the presentation, in the same [human language]() as the video or page.

      

If a screenplay for the video-only content was used to create the content in the first place, this can be a good place to start. In production and editing however, the final version often varies somewhat from the screenplay. To use the screenplay, it would need to be corrected to match the final edited form of the video-only presentation.

#### Examples
- An animation shows how to assemble a woodworking project. There is no audio, but the animation includes a series of numbers to represent each step in the process as well as arrows and picture-in-picture highlights illustrating how the assembly is completed. It also includes short outtake animations illustrating what will happen if assembly is done incorrectly. A text alternative that identifies the video-only content reads, "Breadbox assembly video (text description follows)," and the text description of the video includes a full text description of each step in the video.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. View the video-only content while referring to the alternative for time-based media.
2. Check that the information in the transcript includes the same information that is in the video-only presentation in the same [human language]() as the page or video.
3. If the video includes multiple people or characters, check that the transcript identifies which person or character is associated with each action described.
4. If the alternate version(s) are on a separate page, check for the availability of link(s) to allow the user to get to the other versions.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- All of the above checks are true.

### G164: Providing a stated time within which an online request (or transaction) may be amended or canceled by the user after making the request <a id="g164"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow users to recover from errors made when placing an order by providing them with a period of time during which they can cancel or change the order. In general, a contract or an order is a legal commitment and cannot be canceled. However, a website may choose to offer this capability, and it provides a way for users to recover from errors.

      

The web content would need to tell the user how long the cancellation period is after submitting the form and what the procedure would be to cancel the order. The cancellation procedure may not be possible online. It may, for instance, require written notice be sent to an address listed on the web page.

      

After submitting the form, the user is informed of the length of the cancellation period and the procedure for canceling the transaction. It's best to provide the cancellation procedure at the same website where the transaction was submitted so that it is as easy to cancel as it was to submit and to accommodate users who may be unable to use other mechanisms. But, if necessary, the cancellation procedure may be provided through some other mechanism or combination of mechanisms as long as it has equivalent cross-disability accessibility. In this case, users are warned prior to submitting the form that they will not be able to cancel their order online.

#### Examples
##### Online shopping

         
            

An online shopping website lets users cancel purchases up to 24 hours after they have been made. The website explains their policy, and includes a summary of the policy on the purchase receipt emailed to the user. After 24 hours, the purchase will be shipped to the user and can no longer be canceled.

         
      

      

         

##### Custom orders

         
            

A website sells custom sports jackets that are made to order. The customer chooses the fabric and provides body measurements for the tailor. The website gives customers up to three days to change or cancel an order. Once the material has been cut to the customer's specifications, it is no longer possible to change or cancel the order. The company policy is described on its website.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that the web page describes the time period to cancel or change an order.
2. Check that the web page describes the process for canceling or changing an order.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #2 are true.

### G165: Using the default focus indicator for the platform so that high visibility default focus indicators will carry over <a id="g165"></a>

#### Description
Operating systems have a native indication of focus, which is available in many user agents. The default rendering of the focus indicator isn't always highly visible and may even be difficult to see against certain backgrounds. However, many platforms allow the user to customize the rendering of this focus indicator. Assistive technology can also change the appearance of the native focus indicator. If you use the native focus indicator, any system-wide settings for its visibility will carry over to the web page. If you draw your own focus indicator, for example by coloring sections of the page in response to user action, these settings will not carry over, and AT will not usually be able to find your focus indicator.

#### Examples
The default focus indicator on Microsoft Windows is a one-pixel, black dotted line around the focused element. On a page with a dark background, this can be very difficult to see. The creator of the page uses the default, and the user customizes it in Windows to make it a bright color.

         
      

      

         
            

In HTML, form elements and links can be focused by default. In addition, any element with a tabindex attribute >= 0 can take focus. Both types of focused elements use the system focus indicator and will pick up platform changes in the focus indicator style.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Use the features of your platform to customize the appearance of the focus indicator
2. Tab through the page, noting the path of the focus
3. Check that the focus indicator for each control is visible

### G166: Providing audio that describes the important video content and describing it as such <a id="g166"></a>

#### Description
Video-only content is inaccessible to people who are blind and to some who have low vision. Therefore, it is important for them to have an audio alternative. One way of doing this is to provide an audio track describing the information in the video in the [human language]() of the page. The audio should be a common audio format used on the internet, such as MP3.

#### Examples
A web page has a link to a video-only presentation of a spaceship landing on Mars. The link to the video is a picture of a spaceship. Near the video is a link to an audio file of a person describing the video. This would look something like the following code example in HTML.

```html
<a href="../video/marslanding.mp4">
  <img src="../images/spaceship.jpg" alt="Mars landing, video-only"
   width="193" height="255"/>
</a>
<p><a href="mars-landing-audio.mp3">Audio description of "Mars Landing"</a></p>
```

#### Tests

### G167: Using an adjacent button to label the purpose of a field <a id="g167"></a>

#### Description
When a button invokes a function on an input field, has a clear text label or name, and is rendered adjacent to the input field, the button also acts as a label for the input field. This label helps users understand the purpose of the field without introducing repetitive text on the web page. Buttons that label single text fields typically follow the input field.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> The field must also have a programmatically determined name, per
>               [Success Criterion 4.1.2](../../Understanding/name-role-value).
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
##### A search function

         
            

A web page contains a text field where the user can enter search terms and a button labeled "Search" for performing the search. The button is positioned right after the text field so that it is clear to the user that the text field is where to enter the search term.

            

            	
            

         

Alternatively, a button visually labeled with a "loupe" or "magnify glass" icon, with the alternative text of "search", could be used instead of a button with a text label. Variants of this icon are used to identify search inputs across not just websites, but user interfaces of non-web software as well.

  

      

      

         

##### A "reply" or "send message" field

         

A chat or email web application will often present users a single or multi-line text field used for composing a message. The field does not have a visible text label, but the purpose of the field - to compose a message to send - is indicated by its pairing with a button represented by a "send message" icon. The icon serving the dual purpose of visually labelling the button, as well as the text field.

        

          
        

         
      

     
      

         

##### Picking a form

         
            

A user in the United States must fill in a form. Since the laws and requirements are different in different states within the United States, the user must select the version of a form for their state of residence. A dropdown list allows the user to pick a state. The adjacent button is labeled "Get Form for State." Pressing the button takes the user to the web page containing the form for the selected state.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For a field and a button using this technique:

         

1. Check that the field and button are adjacent to one another in the programmatically determined reading sequence.
2. Check that the field and button are visually rendered adjacent to one another.
3. Where the button does not have a visible text label, check that it has an accessible name

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- All checks are true.

### G168: Requesting confirmation to continue with selected action <a id="g168"></a>

#### Description
This technique is to seek confirmation from the user that the selected action is their intended action. Use this technique in situations where the action can not be undone after it has been followed through. This will help users avoid submitting a form or deleting data by mistake.

      

For example, this may occur when the user expects the 'submit' and 'cancel' buttons to occur in an order contrary to what is provided and selects a button too quickly to notice the unexpected order. Presenting the user with a confirmation request allows the user to recognize the error and either stop the submission of data or stop the loss of entered data.

      

The request for confirmation should inform the user of the action that was selected and the consequences of continuing with the action.

#### Examples
##### Airline travel

         
            

An online travel website lets users create travel itineraries that reserve seats with different airlines. Users may look up, amend and cancel their current itineraries. If the user needs to cancel their travel plans, they find the itinerary on the web page and delete it from their list of current itineraries. This action results in the cancellation of their seat reservations and is not reversible. The user is informed that the selected action will cancel their current seat reservations and that it may not be possible to make a comparable booking on the same flights once this action has been taken. The user is asked to confirm or cancel the deletion of the itinerary.

         
      

      

         

##### Webmail

         
            

A Webmail application stores a user's email on a server, so that it can be accessed from anywhere on the web. When a user deletes an email message, it is moved to a trash folder from which it can be retrieved if it was deleted by accident. There is an "empty trash" command for deleting the messages in the trash folder from the server. Once the trash folder has been emptied, the messages can no longer be retrieved. Before emptying the trash folder, the user is asked to confirm or cancel deletion of the email in the trash folder.

         
      

      

         

##### An online test

         
            

A form is used to collect answers for a test. When the 'submit' or 'reset' button is selected the user is presented with a web page that informs them of their choice and asks for confirmation to continue. Example 1: "You have selected to reset the form. This will delete all previously entered data and will not submit any answers. Would you like to reset the form? [yes button] [no button]" Example 2: "You have selected to submit the form. This will submit entered data as your final answers and can not be changed. Would you like to submit the form? [yes button] [no button]"

         
      

      

         

##### Trading stocks

         
            

A brokerage site allows users to buy and sell stocks and other securities. If the user makes a transaction during trading hours, a dialog is presented informing the user that the transaction is immediate and irreversible, and has buttons that say "continue" and "cancel."

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Initiate the action that can not be reversed or changed.
2. Check that a request to confirm the selected action is presented.
3. Check that the action can be confirmed and canceled.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #2 and #3 are true.

### G170: Providing a control near the beginning of the web page that turns off sounds that play automatically <a id="g170"></a>

#### Description
The intent of this technique is to allow a user to turn off sounds that start automatically when a page loads. The control to turn off the sounds should be located near the beginning of the page to allow the control to be easily and quickly discovered by users. This is useful for those who utilize assistive technologies (such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, switch mechanisms, etc.) and those who may not (such as those with cognitive, learning and language disabilities).

      

In this technique, an author includes a control that makes it possible for users to turn off any sounds that are played automatically. The control should be keyboard operable, located early in the tab and reading order, and clearly labeled to indicate that it will turn off the sounds that are playing.

#### Examples
A web page contains a time-based media presentation that includes an audio track as well as an animated video describing how to repair a lawnmower engine. The page contains 2 buttons that say "Pause" and "Stop", which give the user control over when and if the time-based media plays.

         
      

      

         
            

A web page contains an embedded short film. The page contains a button that says "Pause the movie", which allows the user to pause the film.

         
      

      

         
            

A web page contains a presentation that includes video and audio. The page contains a button that says "Turn off multimedia", which allows the user to stop any video and audio from playing.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Load a web page.
2. Check for music or sounds that start automatically.
3. Check that a control that allows the user to turn off the sounds is provided near the beginning of the page.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check  #3 is true.

### G171: Playing sounds only on user request <a id="g171"></a>

#### Description
The intent of this technique is to allow a user to control the use of sounds in web content. Someone that uses a screen reader may find it very distracting and difficult to listen to their screen reader if there are also sounds coming from web content. Providing a way to play sounds only upon request will give a user the control needed to listen to any sounds or other audio without interfering with the output from a screen reader.

#### Examples
A web page from a grey whale conservation society has a looping background sound of grey whales singing. There are also sounds of water splashing. The sounds do not start automatically. Instead, the web content provides a link at the top of the page to allow the user to start the sounds manually. The button says "Turn sounds on." After pressing the "turn sounds on" button, the sounds are heard. The user is then presented with an option to "turn sounds off."

         
      

      

         
            

A link is provided to a sound file that includes the sounds of the grey whales. The link text says, "Hear the song of the grey whale (mp3)."

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Load a web page that is known to contain sounds that play for 3 seconds or longer.
2. Check that no sounds play automatically.
3. Check that there is a way for a user to start sounds manually.

### G173: Providing a version of a movie with audio descriptions <a id="g173"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a second version of video content that provides audio descriptions in the same [human language]() as the video, so that it is possible for people who cannot see to be able to understand audio-visual material.

      

Since most user agents today cannot merge multiple sound tracks, this technique adds the additional audio information to synchronized media by providing a second version of the movie where the original soundtrack and additional audio description have been combined in a single track. This additional information focuses on actions, characters, scene changes and on-screen text (not captions) that are important to understanding the content.

      

Since it is not helpful to have this new information obscure key audio information in the original sound track (or be obscured by loud sound effects), the new information is added during pauses in dialogue and sound effects. This limits the amount of supplementary information that can be added to program.

      

Providing a second version of the movie that includes audio descriptions as the primary sound track will make this content accessible for blind people who need to hear not only the dialogue, but also the context and other aspects of the video that are not communicated by the characters' dialogue alone.

#### Examples
- Two versions of a video of an opera are available. The first version includes only the music. The second version includes both the music and voice describing the actions of the performers on stage.
- A video of juggler performing in front of group of children includes a version with audio description. The narrator of the audio description describes the number and type of items the juggler is juggling as well as the reactions the children have during the performance.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Open the version of the media that includes audio description.
2. Listen to the movie.
3. Check to see if gaps in dialogue are used to convey important information regarding visual content.
4. If the alternate version(s) are on a separate page, check for the availability of link(s) to allow the user to get to the other versions.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- #3 and #4 are true.

### G174: Providing a control with a sufficient contrast ratio that allows users to switch to a presentation that uses sufficient contrast <a id="g174"></a>

#### Description
When the contrast between the text and its background for some portion of the page has not been designed to meet the contrast level for
            [Success Criterion 1.4.3](../../Understanding/contrast-minimum)
            or
            [1.4.6](../../Understanding/contrast-enhanced), it is possible to meet these guidelines using the "Alternate Version" clause in the conformance requirements ([Conformance Requirement 1](../../Understanding/conformance#conf-req1)). A link or control on the page can either change the page so that all aspects conform, or it could take the viewer to a new version of the page that does conform at the desired level. Placing the link or control prominently on the page will assist users in accessing the conforming content readily.

      

For this technique to be used successfully, three things must be true:

      

1. The link or control on the original page must itself meet the contrast requirement of the desired SC. (If the user cannot see the control they may not be able to use it to go to the new page.)
2. The new page must contain all the same information and functionality as the original page.
3. The new page must conform to all of the SC for the desired level of conformance. (i.e., the new page cannot just have the desired level of contrast but otherwise not conform).

      

This technique can be used to meet Success Criterion 1.4.3 by having text (or images of text) on the alternate version of the page be 4.5:1 contrast and any large text (or images of large text) be 3:1 contrast with its background. If the alternate version of the page has all text (or images of text) with 7:1 contrast and large text (or images of large text) with 4.5:1 contrast then it would satisfy both Success Criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a
>               [conforming alternate version]()

>               for more information.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
- A page with some headlines that do not meet the 3:1 contrast requirements has a high contrast (5:1) link at the top of the page that takes the user to a new version of the page with minimum 4.5:1 contrast on all text and images of text.
- A page uses shaded backgrounds for effect but results in text to background contrast of 4:1. A control at the top of the page says "high contrast". Clicking on it causes different styles to be used and dropping the background colors to achieve 7:1 contrast.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that a link or control exists on the original page that provides access to the alternate version.
2. Check that the link or control on the original page conforms to all success criteria for the conformance level being tested.
3. Check that the alternate version meets the contrast and all other success criteria for the conformance level being tested.

### G176: Keeping the flashing area small enough <a id="g176"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide an easy way to pass the success criterion for things that flash, but are small.

      

If you have something that flashes
            *more*
            than 3 times in a one second period (so G19 can't be used), but the area that is flashing is less than 25% of 10 degrees of visual field (which represents the central area of vision in the eye), then it would automatically pass.

      

The 10 degree of visual field represents the central area of vision in the eye. This area is highly packed with visual sensors. Flashes in this area are transmitted to the visual cortex. For those with photosensitivity, this flashing of activity on the visual cortex can cause seizures. Flashing on other areas of the eye (which have far fewer sensors) has much less effect on the cortex. Hence, the focus on just the 10 degrees of central vision.

      

- If the content is for general web use, you can use
                [Formula 1: Small Safe Area for Web Content](#smallsafe1).
- If the content is for a known display (e.g., in a company foyer) then
                [Formula 2: Small Safe Area for Known Displays](#smallsafe2)
                should be used.

      

**Formula 1: Small Safe Area for Web Content**

      

Most web authors do not know how to translate visual field to pixels, which is what they generally can deal with. This technique provides that translation.

      

At this point in time, the most prevalent display is 1024 x 768 and about 15-17 inches diagonally. When viewed at a typical viewing distance (22-26 inches) a 10 degree visual field will capture an area approximately 341 x 256 pixels. This is not circular, but neither is the central vision of most users, and the difference is so small (and at the edge of the central vision where sensors are fewer) that it is not important.

      

Since the criterion is 25% of any 10 degree visual field,
            **any single flashing event on a screen (there is no other flashing on screen) that is smaller than a contiguous area of 21,824 sq pixels (any shape), would pass the General and Red Flash Thresholds**.

      

1024 x 768 was chosen because it represents the most common screen size. It also works with higher resolution screens since the tighter pixel density would result in a smaller and safer image size.

      

Users with lower resolution displays or that enlarge or view their screens closely would have a higher risk depending on the viewing distance. To address the needs of this group,
            [G19](../general/G19)
            should be used since it is independent of screen resolution or viewing distance.

      

**Formula 2: Small Safe Area for Known Displays**

      

To calculate the
            *small safe area*
            (in pixels) on the screen when the screen size, resolution, and viewing distance is known, use the following procedure.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> For a number of reasons (distribution of central vision sensors often non-circular, simplicity, computational convenience, historical), a 4:3 rectangular approximation of the central 10 degree of visual field is used that is 10 degrees wide and 7.5 degrees high. This has an area of 75 square degrees, vs the 78.5 square degree area of a true circle of 10 degrees.
> 
> 
>

      

1. To convert viewing distance to rectangle size, multiply the viewing distance by 0.1745 (10 * Pi / 180) to get the width of the rectangle, and multiply the viewing distance by 0.1309 (7.5 * Pi / 180) to get the height of the rectangle. (This calculation can be done in inches, or millimeters, or any other unit of length.)
2. Determine size of 10 degree angle of view in pixels.

            

To do this, multiply the width and height of the rectangle from step 1 by the resolution of the screen, in pixels per unit length, to get the horizontal and vertical size of the rectangle in pixels.

            

- For a 1080p widescreen display (which is 1920 by 1080 pixels), the resolution of the screen in pixels per inch is 2203 divided by the diagonal screen size, in inches.
- For a 720p widescreen display (which is usually 1365 by 768 pixels), the resolution of the screen in pixels per inch is 1566 divided by the diagonal screen size, in inches.
- For an LCD computer monitor which specifies the pixel pitch in millimeters / pixel, the resolution of the screen in pixels per inch is 25.4 divided by the pixel pitch in millimeters.

            

For any display, if you know the actual diagonal screen size in inches, and the horizontal and vertical resolution of the display in pixels, then the resolution of the screen in pixels per inch is the square-root of ( (horizontal resolution in pixels) * (horizontal resolution in pixels) + (vertical resolution in pixels) * (vertical resolution in pixels) ).
3. Multiply the width of the rectangle by the height and divide by 4.

#### Examples
- An author creates an animation that will be displayed on a screen in the entrance lounge at a company. Using the size and resolution of the display and the closest distance that a person can stand when viewing the display, they calculate the size of 25% of the 10 degree of central vision in pixels (using the formula above). This would be the
                *small safe area*. They then are careful to never flash any area larger than the
                *small safe area*.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. The
                  *small safe area*
                  is calculated.
2. Check that only one area of the screen is flashing at any time.
3. Check that the flashing content would fit into a contiguous container whose area is less than the
                  *small safe area*.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #2 and #3 are true.

### G177: Providing suggested correction text <a id="g177"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to suggest correct text where the information supplied by the user is not accepted and possible correct text is known. The suggestions may include correct spelling or similar text from a known pool of possible text.

      

Depending on the form, suggestions could be located next to the field where the error was identified, elsewhere on the page or via a search mechanism or reference where results would be listed on another URI. Where possible, suggestions for correction should be incorporated in a way that is easy for the user. For example, an incorrect submission may return a list of possible corrections where the user can select a checkbox or radio button to indicate which option was intended. Suggestions or links to the suggestions should be placed close to the form fields they are associated with, such as at the top of the form, preceding the form fields, or next to the form fields requiring correction.

#### Examples
- A form field requires the user to input a length of time that could range from days to years. The user enters the number "6". The server returns the form as the user had submitted it and also includes a suggested text next to the form field: "Error detected. Did you mean: 6 days, 6 weeks, 6 months or 6 years?"
- The user enters an incorrectly spelled city name. The server returns the form as the user had submitted it and also includes a message at the top of the form informing the user of the error and a link to a list of city names that the user may have meant, as determined by comparing their original input to a database of city names.
- A bus route trip planner allows users to enter their origin an destination, allowing users to enter street addresses, intersections and city landmarks. When a user enters "Kohl," they are prompted with a list of search results with similar matches that reads, "Your search for 'Kohl' returned the following". A select box follows the prompt lists, "Kohl Center," "Kohl's Dept. Store-East" and "Kohl's Dept. Store-West" as options the user can choose from.
- A search runs a spell check on input and provides a link of alternatives if a spelling error is detected. When the user clicks on the link, the search is automatically resubmitted with the correct spelling.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Identify form fields where correct text could be inferred from incorrect text.
2. Fill out the form, deliberately filling in the identified form fields with incorrect text.
3. Check that the user is presented with suggestions for the correct text.
4. Check that the suggestions are provided next to the form field or a link to the suggestions is provided close to the form field.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #3 and #4 are true.

### G178: Providing controls on the web page that allow users to incrementally change the size of all text on the page up to 200 percent <a id="g178"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide a mechanism on the web page to incrementally increase the size of text. Many people with low vision do not use magnifying software, and they may not be familiar with their browser's text size adjustments. This may be particularly true of older people who are learning about computers later in life and who may be experiencing age related vision loss. It may also be true of some people with cognitive disabilities who require increased font size.

      

This technique provides a mechanism that some users will find easier to use. The mechanism may include links or buttons that will switch the visual presentation to a different style sheet or use scripts to change the text size dynamically.

      

To implement this technique, an author provides controls that allow the user to incrementally increase or decrease the text size of all of the text on the page to a size up to 200% of the default text size.

      

This can be achieved by providing links, buttons or linked images and the controls themselves should be as easy to find (e.g. prominently positioned within the page, presented in a larger text size, high contrast, etc.) as possible.

      

This technique can also be used in circumstances where scalable fonts cannot be used, such as legacy code situations.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a [conforming alternate version]() for non-conforming content. Refer to [C29: Using a style switcher to provide a conforming alternate version](../css/C29) and [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](../../Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions) for more information.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
- A newspaper article has two buttons near the top of the page. The "increase text size" button has a big letter "T" with an upward arrow and the "decrease text size" button has a small letter "T" with a down arrow. There is `alt` text on each button.
- A site has a number of style sheets with different text size. The user can choose any of the style sheets if their browser provides this functionality. Each page also includes the links "Increase text size" and "Decrease text size" that will change the style sheet currently applied to the appropriate alternate style sheet.
- A site includes the text "Change text size:" followed by text links "Up" and "Down" on every web page. The links trigger a Javascript that alters the value of the text-size property accordingly.
- A site includes a link on every page that reads "Change text size." The resulting page includes a series of links that includes options representing the available sizes. The links read, "Smallest font size," "Small font size," "Default font size," "Large font size," etc. Instructions preceding the list direct users to choose a link to change to the desired font size.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Set the viewport size to 1024px by 768px or larger.
2. Increase the text size and check to see if the text size increased.
3. Check that the text size can be increased to 200% of the original size.
4. Check that after increasing the text size to 200% of the original size, there is no loss of content or functionality (e.g. no parts of the text are clipped, boxes do not overlap, controls are not obscured or separated from their labels, etc.).
5. Decrease the text size to its default value and check to see if it in fact returned to the default size.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #2, #3, #4 and #5 are true.

### G179: Ensuring that there is no loss of content or functionality when the text resizes and text containers do not change their width <a id="g179"></a>

#### Description
Some user agents support changing the size of text without changing other dimensions of the text container. Loss of content or functionality can occur when the text overflows the space that was allocated for it. However, the layout properties may provide a way to continue to display the content effectively. The block sizes may be defined wide enough that the text does not overflow when resized by 200%. Text may wrap when it no longer fits within the block, and the block may be tall enough that all the text continues to fit in the block. The block may provide scrollbars when the resized text no longer fits.

#### Examples
##### A multi-column page layout

         
            

HTML and CSS are used to create a two-column layout for a page of text. Using the default value of the
                white-space
                property,
                normal, causes text to wrap. So as the size of the text is increased to 200%, the text reflows and the column of text grows longer. If the column is too long for the viewport, the user agent provides scrollbars so the user can scroll text into view because the author has specified the CSS rule
                overflow:scroll
                or
                overflow:auto.

         
      

      

         
            

A newspaper layout with blocks of text in columns. The blocks have a fixed width, but no height set. When the text is resized in the browser, the text wraps and makes the blocks taller.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Increase text size to 200%.
2. Check whether all content and functionality is available.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #2 is true.

### G180: Providing the user with a means to set the time limit to 10 times the default time limit <a id="g180"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to give people with disabilities enough time to complete tasks which may take them longer than someone without those challenges. Some mechanism such as a preference setting or a control on the page lets the user change the time limits to at least 10 times the default time limit. Preferably, the mechanism would have a variable adjustment that lets the user change the time limit to any value in its range, but could also provide ways to change the time limit by discrete increments. The user changes the time limit at the beginning of their session, before any activity that has a time limit.

#### Examples
- An airline has an online ticket purchasing application. By default, the application has a 1 minute time limit for each step of the purchase process. At the beginning of the session, a web page includes information that says, "We expect that each step in the purchasing process will take users one minute to complete. Would you like to adjust the time limit?" followed by several radio buttons "1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes."
- A web-based email application automatically logs users out when there has been no activity for 30 minutes. The application includes a preference that allows users to adjust the amount of time to any value.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check to see if there is a mechanism to set the time limit to 10 times the default time limit.
2. Change the time limit to a new value that is 10 times the default time limit.
3. Perform an action that has a time limit.
4. Wait until the default time limit has passed.
5. Check that the time limit does not expire until the limit specified in step 2 has passed.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #5 are true.

### G182: Ensuring that additional visual cues are available when text color differences are used to convey information <a id="g182"></a>

#### Description
The intent of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may not be able to discern a difference in text color. Color is commonly used to indicate the different status of words that are part of a paragraph or other block of text or where special characters or graphics cannot be used to indicate which words have special status. For example, scattered words in text may be hypertext links that are marked as such by being printed in a different color. This technique describes a way to provide cues in addition to color so that users who may have difficulty perceiving color differences or have low vision can identify them.

      

To use this technique, an author incorporates a visual cue in addition to color for each place where color alone is used to convey information. Visual cues can take many forms including changes to the font style, the addition of underlines, bold, or italics, or changes to the font size.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> While this technique is sufficient to meet the visual requirements of Success Criterion 1.4.1, the information conveyed by the color must also be available programmatically to satisfy Success Criterion 1.3.1. See
>               [How to Meet 1.3.1](../../Understanding/info-and-relationships).
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
- The default formatting for links on a page includes presenting them both in a different color than the other text on the page underlining them to make the links identifiable even without color vision.
- An article comparing the use of similar elements in different markup languages uses colored text to identify the elements from each language. Elements from the first markup language are identified using BLUE, bolded text. Elements from the second are presented as RED, italicized text.
- A news site lists links to the articles appearing on its site. Additional information such as the section the article appears in, the time the article was posted, a related location or an indication that it is accompanied by live video appears in some cases. The links to the articles are in a different color than the additional information but the links are not underlined, and each link is presented in a larger font than the rest of the information so that users who have problems distinguishing between colors can identify the links more easily.
- Short news items sometimes have sentences that are also links to more information. Those sentences are printed in color and use a sans-serif font face while the rest of the paragraph is in black Times-Roman.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Locate all instances where the color of text is used to convey information.
2. Check that any text where color is used to convey information is also styled or uses a font that makes it visually distinct from other text around it.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #2 is true.

### G183: Using a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text and providing additional visual cues on hover for links or controls where color alone is used to identify them <a id="g183"></a>

#### Description
The intent of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may not be able to discern a difference in text color. Color (generally defined as a combination of hue, saturation and luminance) is commonly used to indicate words that are links within a paragraph or other block of text. For example, scattered words in text may be hypertext links that are identified only by a difference in color with surrounding text. This technique describes a way to provide a difference in contrast rather than relying on hue.

      

To meet Success Criterion 1.4.1: Use of Color a [relative luminance]() (lightness) difference of 3:1 or greater with the text around can be used. This technique goes beyond the success criterion and asks for visual highlights when the user hovers over each link, such as an underline, a change in font style such as bold or italics, or an increase in font size. Such a hover effect provides confirmation to pointer users that the text is a link, similar to how the link alters its appearance for keyboard users when it receives focus, in order to meet [2.4.7 Focus Visible](../../Understanding/focus-visible).

      

While using this technique is sufficient to meet this success criterion, it is not the preferred technique to differentiate link text. This is because links that use the relative luminance of color alone may not be obvious to people with low vision. If there are not a large number of links in the block of text, underlines are recommended for links in blocks of text.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> This technique is about the use of color in addition to luminosity. In this technique, the contrast ratio refers to the contrast between a link and the words around it. In Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast ratio refers to the contrast between a word and its background. The difference is that  this technique is about the ability for users to tell the difference (a noticeable difference) between different pieces of text whereas the contrast ratio used in Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 is about the readability of the text with its background for different color and vision disabilities.
> 
> 
>          
> 
> If an author wants to use the color portion of this technique (i.e., using different colors for the words where the colors have sufficient contrast with each other) and the author also wants to conform to SC 1.4.3 (contrast of both words with their backgrounds) the following colors can be used (e.g., black text in a paragraph on a white background with the links shown as one of the colors in example 1 below).
> 
> 
>          
> 
> If assistive technology or web browsers at some point all provide an option to underline all links on web pages for users, this could be used instead of an author-provided link highlighting mechanism.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
##### Colors that would provide 3:1 contrast with black words and 4.5:1 contrast with a white background

         
            

Refer to
                [Links with a 3:1 contrast ratio with surrounding text](../../working-examples/link-contrast/)

         
      

      

         
            

The hypertext links in a document are medium-light blue (`#3366CC`) and the regular text is black (`#000000`). Beyond the difference in color, the links have no other styles differences compared with the regular text. Because the blue text is light enough, it has a contrast of 3.9:1 with the surrounding text and can be identified as being different from the surrounding text by people with all types of color vision deficiency, including those individuals who cannot see color at all. In addition to the contrast difference, the links have `:focus` and `:hover` styles that reintroduce the underline when the links receive keyboard focus or when a mouse pointer hovers over them. Hover or focus style changes alone are not sufficient to meet the criterion.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

        

For each instance where color is used to convey information about text:

         

1. Check that the [relative luminance]() of the color of the text differs from the relative luminance of the surrounding text by a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
2. Check that hovering over the link causes a visual enhancement (such as an underline, font change, etc.)

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #2 are true.

### G186: Using a control in the web page that stops moving, blinking, or auto-updating content <a id="g186"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide the user a control that allows him to stop moving or blinking content. Since the control is in the web page, the control itself meets the appropriate level of WCAG conformance e.g., it has appropriate contrast, it has a name that identifies it, it is keyboard accessible. The control is either at the top of the page or adjacent to the moving content. A single control may stop all moving or blinking content on the page, or there may be separate controls for separate parts of the content.

#### Examples
##### Stock Market Ticker Tape

         
            

A web page displays the latest stock market results in a "ticker tape" that automatically scrolls across the bottom of the screen. A "Pause" button lets the user stop the ticker tape. When the ticker tape is unpaused, it resumes displaying the current stock market information.

         
      

      

         

##### Teleconferencing Tool

         
            

A teleconferencing web page displays a speaker queue of people who wish to speak. A checkbox on the page lets the user choose whether the display of the queue should be updated automatically when a new person is added or removed, or whether it should only be updated when the user presses the "Refresh" button. When the queue is being updated automatically, the Refresh button is deactivated.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that there is a control on the web page to stop the motion.
2. Activate the control.
3. Check that the motion, blinking  or auto-updating has stopped.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #3 are true.

### G191: Providing a link, button, or other mechanism that reloads the page without any blinking content <a id="g191"></a>

#### Description
This is a general technique for allowing people who cannot use a page with blinking content to turn the blinking content off.
            [Conformance Requirement 1](../../Understanding/conformance#conf-req1)
            allows for conforming alternate pages to be used to meet conformance. This technique is an example of that approach applied to success criteria 2.2.2.

      

It is important that the page without blinking content contain all of the information that was on the page with blinking content.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> Removing the content that was blinking from the page would only be satisfactory if the blinking content was redundant with non blinking content in the original page.
> 
> 
>          
> 
> This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a

>               for more information.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
- A page has blinking text at the top warning users that they should not submit the page without first registering. A link at the very top of the page reloads the page with the blinking text replaced with text that is styled to be highly visible but does not blink.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that there is a mechanism to reload page to turn off blinking.
2. Check that reloaded page has no blinking.
3. Check that the reloaded page has all the information and functionality of the original page.

### G193: Providing help by an assistant in the web page <a id="g193"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide help using a multimedia avatar that provides assistance in using the web page. An avatar can be particularly helpful to people with cognitive disabilities who may have trouble reading text. The use of visuals will help some people to focus on the material presented.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> The multimedia avatar must also satisfy relevant success criterion in
>               [Guideline 1.2](../../Understanding/time-based-media).
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
- The home page of an online banking application has an embedded avatar named Vanna. She gives new online banking clients a tour of the features provided in the application. The assistant can be started and stopped and paused. The client can rewind and fast forward through the material. A text alternative of the information is available from a link next to the avatar.
- A volunteer site has a welcoming page for new volunteers. In it there is an application form. On the right side of the page there an interactive multimedia file with an avatar that explains all the features and sections of the application form.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that there is an assistant in the web page.
2. Check that the assistant provides information to help understand the content of the page.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- All of the above checks are true.

### G195: Using an author-supplied, visible focus indicator <a id="g195"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is enhance the focus indicator in the browser, by creating a visible one in the content. The default focus indicator in some browsers is a thin, dotted, black line. It can be difficult to see the line when it is around a form element which already has an outline, when the focused element is inside a table cell, when the focused element is very small, or when the background of the page is a dark color. Some browsers use a pale blue outline, which can be difficult to see on some backgrounds.

      

In this technique, when the user places focus on an element using the keyboard, the application makes that focus more visible, using a combination of a highly contrasting color, a thick line, and other visual indicators such as a glow.

#### Examples
##### Links

            

A web page has a dark background color and light text and links. When focus lands on a link, the link is outlined with a bright yellow line, 3 pixels wide.

      

      

         

##### Form Elements

         
            

A web page includes a form inside a table. The borders of both the table and the form elements are thin, black lines. When focus lands on a form element, the element is outlined with a 5 pixel red line that is partially transparent. The red is equivalent to a hex color of #FF3838, providing a 3.6:1 contrast ratio with the white background.

         
      

      

         

##### Menus

         
            

A web page includes an interactive menu with sub-menus. A user can move focus in the menu using the arrow keys. As focus moves, the currently focused menu item changes its background to a different color, which has a 3:1 contrast ratio with the surrounding items and a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its own text.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each user interface component on the page that should receive keyboard focus:

         

1. Navigate to the component and check that it has a visible focus indicator.
2. Check that the focus indicator area is at least the size of a 1 CSS px border around the component.
3. If the focus indicator area is not at least equal to the area of a 1 CSS pixel border, check that it has an area of at least 4 CSS pixels along the shortest side of the component.
4. Check that the change of contrast of the indicator between focused and unfocused states has a ratio of 3:1 or more for the minimum focus indicator area.
5. If the focus indicator does not have 3:1 contrast ratio with its adjacent colors, check that it is at least 2px thick.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #2, #4, and #5 are true.

### G196: Using a text alternative on one item within a group of images that describes all items in the group <a id="g196"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to avoid unnecessary duplication that occurs when a grouping of adjacent non-text content is used to present information or functionality.

      

In some cases, pages will present a group of images to convey information. When presented together or in a specific combination these groupings can convey different types of information. For example, two images of a star where one is presented in black and white and the other is colored can be used in combination to represent a user rating. For example, three filled stars followed by two unfilled stars might represent a rating of three out of five stars.

      

To use this technique, an author provides a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose for the entire group and associates it with one item in the group. The other items in the group are then marked in a way that can be ignored by assistive technologies. In this way, the user is able to more efficiently identify the purpose of the group and can avoid duplication or confusion that may result had a text alternative been provided for each item in the group.

#### Examples
##### A rating system in HTML

			

In the following example, a rating is shown as three filled stars and two empty stars. While a text alternative could have been provided for each of the five images, the author has instead provided the rating in the form "3 out of 5 stars" for the first image and has marked the others using null alt text.

```html
<p>Rating: 
  <img src="star-filled" alt="3 out of 5 stars">
  <img src="star-filled" alt="">
  <img src="star-filled" alt="">
  <img src="star-empty" alt="">
  <img src="star-empty" alt="">
</p>
```

      

      

				

##### Buttons created with groups of images in HTML

				

In this example, each button has a set of images to indicate the level of conformance to WCAG being claimed. This approach makes it possible for assistive technologies to avoid announcing things like, "Image A, Image A, Image A" etc.

 

```html
<p>Conformance Level:</p>
<button name="A" type="button">
  <img src="a.png" alt="A">
</button>
<button name="AA" type="button">
  <img src="a.png" alt="AA">
  <img src="a.png" alt="">
</button>
<button name="AAA" type="button">
  <img src="a.png" alt="AAA">
  <img src="a.png" alt="">
  <img src="a.png" alt="">
</button>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that one item in the group includes a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose for the entire group.
2. Check that the other items in the group are marked in a way that can be ignored by assistive technologies.
3. Check that the items marked in a way that can be ignored by assistive technologies are adjacent to the item that contains the text alternative for the group.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- All of the above checks are true.

### G197: Using labels, names, and text alternatives consistently for content that has the same functionality <a id="g197"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to help  users with cognitive disabilities, blindness and vision loss to understand what will happen when they interact with a function on a web page. If there are different labels on user interface components (i.e., elements, links, JavaScript objects, etc.) that have the same function, the user will not know that they have encountered a component with the same function and will not know what to expect. This could lead to many unnecessary errors. It is also recommended that this approach to consistent labelling be applied across the website.

#### Examples
- A web page has a form field at the top of the page labeled "Search". On the bottom of the page is another form field which provides the same function. It is also labeled "Search."
- A picture of a question mark is used to steer users to sections of the page that provide additional information. Each time the picture of the question mark appears it has the same text alternative "more information."
- A link to the Contact Us page of a website has the link text "Contact". At the bottom of the page there is a link that also goes to the Contact Us page. It also has the link text "Contact".

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that each component is associated with text that identifies it (i.e., label, name, or text alternative).
2. Check that this associated text is identical for each user interface component with the same function.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #2 are true.

### G198: Providing a way for the user to turn the time limit off <a id="g198"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for people who cannot complete tasks within a specified time limit to turn off the time limit.

      

It is essential that the mechanism for turning off the time limit can be completed without a time limit itself and before the time limit for the page expires. To do this - the mechanism should be available at or near the top of the page so that it can be found and activated quickly by people with a wide range of disabilities.

#### Examples
- A page has a listing of news headlines that automatically update every minute. At the top of the page is a link that turns off the updating.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that there is a mechanism to turn off any time limits near the top of the page.
2. Verify that the time limit for the page is long enough that a user can easily navigate to the mechanism even if they are 10 times slower than most users.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #2 are true.

### G202: Ensuring keyboard control for all functionality <a id="g202"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide keyboard operation for all the functionality of the page. When all functionality of content can be operated through a keyboard or keyboard interface, it can be operated by those with no vision as well as by those who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators like speech input software or on-screen keyboards.

	  

A [keyboard interface]() allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the computing device that they are using does not contain a hardware keyboard. For example, many mobile devices have keyboard interfaces within their operating system as well the option to connect external wireless keyboards. Applications can use the interface to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other services that provide simulated keyboard output, such as switch devices, handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text applications.

      

To implement this technique, first determine what functionality is available to users on the page. In this step, it is important to consider functions performed using both the mouse and the keyboard together. Examples of functionality include the use of physical controls such as links, menus, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons and form fields as well as the use of features like drag and drop, selecting text, resizing regions or bringing up context menus. Other examples of functionality may based on tasks such as adding or removing an item from a shopping cart or initiating a chat session with a sales representative.

      

Once the functionality of the content has been determined, the author verifies that each of the functions identified can be performed using only the keyboard.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> This does not necessarily mean that each of the individual controls can be used from the keyboard as long as there are multiple methods to perform the same function available on the page. Authors are advised to consider how users will discover any keyboard equivalents which are available.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
- A page with images used as links changes when the user hovers over the image with a mouse. To provide keyboard users with a similar experience, the image is also changed when a user tabs to it.
- A page that allows users to click and drag items in a list to reorder them also includes a series of controls that allows keyboard users to move items up, down or to the beginning and end of the list.
- The mobile version of a website includes a menu button that is tapped to open a site menu, which is implemented as a floating overlay. To provide access to people using external keyboards or ability switches with their mobile device, the menu button and the site menu are both implemented such that they can be operated via the mobile device's keyboard interface.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Identify all functionality on the content.
2. Check that all functionality can be accessed using only the keyboard or keyboard interface.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #2 is true.

### G203: Using a static text alternative to describe a talking head video <a id="g203"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide an alternative to audio description for synchronized media that has no important time based information contained in the video portion of the media. This particularly applies to "talking head" videos where a person is talking in front of an unchanging background, such as a press conference, company president talk, or government announcement, etc. In this case there are no "important visual details" which would warrant audio description.

      

Audio description is not necessary when there is one person speaking against an unchanging background because there is no time-based visual information in the video that is "important" to the understanding of the content. The environment is static and therefore can be described in a non-multimedia static format such as alternative text that is programmatically associated with the video.

      

All that is necessary in this case is a static text alternative which would contain a general description of the context of the environment, any opening/closing credits, any text that appears in the bottom of the video with the name of the speaker, and other basic information, if these are seen on the screen and cannot be heard in the audio.

      

This technique does NOT apply to a situation where there are multiple speakers and where the identity of each new speaker is not evident in the audio track but is identified on screen with visual text as they speak. In this case, audio description should be used, and this  technique would not apply.

#### Examples
##### A video of a CEO speaking to shareholders

         
            

A CEO is speaking to shareholders from their office. The video has a title page at the beginning of the video giving the date. When the speaker begins, there is a strip of text at the bottom of the video saying "Jane Doe, President of XYZ Cooperation". At the end of the video are title credits that say "produced by the Honest TV Productions Ltd."

            

As an alternative, there is a paragraph below the video which is associated with the video file using aria-describedby which says: "July 22, 2011, Jane Doe, President of XYZ cooperation, speaking from her office. Video produced by the Honest TV Productions Ltd."

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check that there is no important time-based information in the video track
2. Check that the programmatically associated description of the media contains any context of the content that is not contained in the audio track (e.g. speaker identification, credits, context)

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- All checks are true.

### G205: Including a text cue for colored form control labels <a id="g205"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to combine color and text or character cues to convey information. Most users can quickly scan the content to locate information conveyed by using color differences. Users who cannot see color can look or listen for text cues; people using Braille displays or other tactile interfaces can detect text cues by touch.

      

The text cue must be included as part of the programmatically determinable name for the control.

#### Examples
##### Required fields in an HTML form

				

The instructions for an online form say, "Required fields are shown in red and marked with (required)." The cue "(required)" is included within the label element.

```html
<style>
  .required {
    color:#ec0000;
  }
</style>
<label for="lastname" class="required">Last name (required):</label>
<input autocomplete="family-name" id="lastname" type="text" value="">
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For any content where color differences are used to convey information:

         

1. Check that the same information is available through text or character cues.

      

      

				

##### Expected Results

				

- Check #1 is true.

### G206: Providing options within the content to switch to a layout that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text <a id="g206"></a>

#### Description
There may be situations where an author needs to use a layout that requires horizontal scrolling. In that case, it is sufficient to provide options within the content that switch to a layout that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text. This may be achieved using standard style switching technology.

      

It should be noted that it is also sufficient to lay out the content in such a way that horizontal scrolling is required to access content, but that it is not necessary to scroll horizontally in order to read a line of text.

      

For instance, a spreadsheet that requires horizontal scrolling is acceptable if no horizontal scrolling is necessary for each column individually (i.e., scrolling is only necessary to see other columns, but not for the left or right edges of each individual column).

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a [conforming alternate version]() for non-conforming content. Refer to [C29: Using a style switcher to provide a conforming alternate version](../css/C29) and [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](../../Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions) for more information.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
A real estate company has an online annual report that has an identical layout to that of their print version, and as such, requires horizontal scrolling to read a line of text. A control is on the page that switches the stylesheet and provides a layout that does not require horizontal scrolling.

         
      

      

         
            

A financial spreadsheet is online. It includes text explaining changes in the housing market in January. Off-screen to the right, there is a column with an explanation of changes to the market in September. The user can horizontally scroll to the September area and read each line of text without any further scrolling when the window size is maximized.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Open the content that requires horizontal scrolling on a full screen window.
2. Check that there is an option within the content to switch to a layout that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text.
3. Activate the option.
4. Check to make sure that horizontal scrolling is not required to read any line of text.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #2 and #4 are true.

### G207: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of 3:1 is provided for icons <a id="g207"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure graphical icons provide enough contrast for people with vision impairments. Not all graphics are within the scope of [SC 1.4.11 Non-text contrast](../../Understanding/non-text-contrast.html) but if the icons are required to understand the content, then the icons need to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

            

The success criteria for non-text contrast uses the term ["graphical object"](../../Understanding/non-text-contrast.html#graphical-objects) to cover small simple graphics, and parts of larger complex graphics. This technique focuses on solid color icons used on solid or gradient backgrounds.

            

When choosing the colors for graphics, consider the color(s) adjacent to that graphic, and test that the contrast ratio is at least 3:1.

            

A selection of tools and applications for testing contrast ratios can be found in [Understanding SC 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)](../../Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#resources).

#### Examples
##### Solid icon color against the background

				

A solid icon such as a telephone symbol uses orange on a white background. The color orange (`#E3660E`) is tested against the white background (`#FFFFFF`) and it has a contrast ratio of 3.4:1.

				

            

            

				

##### Solid icon color against a custom background

				

A solid icon such as a telephone symbol used within an orange background. The orange and white colors are the same as in example 1, in this case the contrast against the white background is not relevant, the white icon within the orange background is what provides the information in the icon and as a result needs to meet the contrast requirement.

				

            

            

				

##### Solid icon with a gradient background

				

A solid icon such as a telephone symbol using a dark blue icon on a white-to-blue gradient background. The first test of the icon should be against the darkest (least contrasting) background that is adjacent to the icon color. If that is at least 3:1, it passes the success criterion.

				

            

            

				

##### Solid icon with gradient background overlapping in contrast

                

A solid icon on a gradient background can overlap in contrast if the graphic is still understandable where it does not have contrast against all of the background. If you find the part of the gradient where it does not meet a 3:1 ratio with the graphic and treat that part as if it was removed, does the icon still convey the appropriate meaning?

                

A method of visualizing this is to remove the non-contrasting area and check that you can still understand the icon. If so, it is sufficient. The images below shows an icon on a gradient background, and a second version where it removes the area of the icon  that does not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio. It is still recognizable as a phone icon, so passes the success criterion.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

                

For each graphical object required for understanding use a color contrast tool to:

				

1. Determine the foreground color of the graphical object.
2. Determine the adjacent background color. If the background color is a gradient or pattern, identify the color with the least contrast to the foreground color.
3. Check that the contrast ratio is equal to or greater than 3:1.
4. If part of the background area does not meet 3:1 with the foreground, assume that parts of the icon adjacent to the area or areas are not visible.
5. Check that the icon is still recognizable without any area of insufficient contrast.

- #3 and #5 are true.

### G208: Including the text of the visible label as part of the accessible name <a id="g208"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that speech input users can operate web content reliably.

			

When speech input users interact with a web page, they usually speak a command followed by the reference to some visible label (like text in a button, the link text, or the text labelling input fields). For example, they may speak "click search" to activate a search button.

			

When speech recognition software processes speech input and looks for matches, it uses the "accessible name" of controls, which can be different from the visible label. For example, a  button following a search input field may contain the text "go" but uses an invisible `aria-label` attribute with the value "search". Since aria-label takes precedence over the text included in the button, the accessible name of this button will be "search", not "go". The [Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/) defines how the accessible name is constructed.

			

In situations where the visible label is considered inadequate as the accessible name, it is possible to supplement text in the accessible name. However, in order to meet 2.5.3 Label in Name, the text string that makes up the visible label must occur in its entirety in the accessible name. In most situations, where it is felt that additional context is needed, it is recommended that the visible text should precede the additional text. When authors make sure that the visible label of a control is included, intact, in the accessible name of that control, speech input users can be confident that their input will be correctly interpreted.

			

Additional context may be more appropriately included using the Accessible Description (including through use of `aria-describedby`). This has the significant benefit of improving context for some users of assistive technology without altering the accessible name.

#### Examples
##### Link text matches the beginning of the accessible name

		

A link contains visible text and hidden link text. Both together make up the link's accessible name. The visible text comes first. The idea is to make the link more descriptive for users of assistive technologies.

	
		`<p>Go to <a href="code-of-conduct.html">Code of conduct <span class="hidden_accessibly"> of ACME Corporation</span></a><p>`
	

	

	

		

##### Generic link text concatenated with heading

		

A generic link is combined with the heading of the paragraph to give context. It is a variation on the first example, this time using `aria-labelledby`. The advantage of this implementation is that it uses existing visible text on the page, and so is more likely to be properly translated during any localization transformations.

				`
					<h4 id="poor">Insufficient Link Names Invade Community</h4>
<p>Citizens are reeling from the growing invasion of useless "read more" links appearing in their online resources. <a href="poor.html" aria-labelledby="generic poor"><span id="generic">More...</span></a>
`
		

		

###### Insufficient Link Names Invade Community

[The following link opens nothing] Citizens are reeling from the growing invasion of useless "read more" links appearing in their online resources. [More...](#poor)

		

	

	

		

##### Link text included in aria-label

		

Where two strings cannot be grammatically or seamlessly combined using `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` can be used to make a new name which includes the visible label.

		`
			...end of news story. <a href="poor.html" aria-label="Read more about Insufficient link names">Read more</a>
		`
	

	

		
		

##### The visible button text matches the beginning of the accessible name

		

The visible text inside a `button` element matches the beginning of accessible name, which also includes hidden text. The idea of the hidden text is to make the button more descriptive for users of assistive technologies.

	
		`<button>Send <span class="accessibly-hidden"> Mail</span></button>`

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For all controls with a visible label, check that:

				

1. The accessible name of the control contains the same letters in the same order as the visible label.

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- Check #1 true.

        

If this is a sufficient technique for a success criterion, failing this test procedure does not necessarily mean that the success criterion has not been satisfied in some other way, only that this technique has not been successfully implemented and can not be used to claim conformance.

### G209: Provide sufficient contrast at the boundaries between adjoining colors <a id="g209"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure people with moderately low vision can distinguish boundaries between adjoining segments of color.

            

The success criteria for non-text contrast uses the term "graphical object" to cover small simple graphics, and parts of larger complex graphics. This technique focuses on solid color segments where the boundaries between colors convey meaning.

            

When selecting colors for graphics with multiple colors, consider adjoining colors and test that the contrast ratio is at least 3:1. If adjoining colors have less than 3:1 color contrast ratio difference add a border with at least a 3:1 color contrast with each color.

#### Examples
##### Pie chart with alternative light/dark colors

				
                    
                    The contrast between adjoining segments of the pie chart range from 5.8 to 9.4.
                
            

			

				

##### Pie chart with borders between segments

				
                    
                    The contrast between the segments of the pie chart range from 1.1 to 1.8. A border has been added with at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with the colors to distinguish between segments. .
                
            

			

				

##### Map with border boundaries

				
                    
                    The color contrast of areas within the map range between 1.3 and 1.8. A boundary line is added with a color contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the area colors.
                
            

			

				

##### Pie chart with black and white borders

				
                    
                    The colored areas in the chart are both dark and light. A black and white boundary line is added to ensure sufficient contrast between both light and dark colors.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

                

For each graphical object required for understanding use a color contrast tool to:

				

1. Measure the contrast ratio of each color compared to the adjacent color(s) or border (if present).
2. Check that the contrast ratio is at least 3:1 for each adjacent color or border (if present).

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- #2 is true

### G210: Ensuring that drag-and-drop actions can be cancelled <a id="g210"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who use a path-based drag-and-drop action to move an item from the initial location to a drop target can abort the action after picking up the target. This can be done either by releasing the item outside a drop area, or by moving the item back to its original position in a separate action that undoes the first action. A third option is to have a step after the element is dropped onto target, either with a dialog asking for confirmation of the action when the item is dropped, or providing an undo command.

			

This technique addresses pointer actions where support has been implemented by authors, not gestures provided by the user agent (such as horizontal swiping to move through the browser history or vertical swiping to scroll through page content) or the operating system (e.g., gestures to move between open apps, or call up contextual menus of assistive technologies when these are enabled).

			

##### User Agent and Assistive Technology Support Notes

			

On touch screen devices, author-supplied path-based and multipoint gestures usually do not work when OS level assistive technologies (AT) like a built-in screenreader is turned on. AT generally consumes path-based or multipoint gestures so they would not reach the authored content. For example, a horizontal drag gesture may not move a slider thumb as intended by the author, but move the screen reader focus to the next or previous element. Some gestures may work if the user operates "pass through gestures" which are often unreliable as they may depend on factors of hardware, operating system, operating system "skin", operating system setting, or user agent.

#### Examples
- A site shows a file directory. Files can be picked up and moved over a trash can icon. When the picked-up file is released outside this target, it reverts to the old position.
- A site shows a file directory. Files can be picked up and moved over a trash can icon to delete it. When the picked-up file is released over the trash can, a modal dialog asks the user to confirm or cancel the delete action.
- A kanban implementation of a project planning site shows different columns for phases of an activity. Users can pick up and move icons representing planning items to another column. When an item has been picked up and now follows the pointer, it can be moved outside the drop targets (columns) and dropped there to cancel the action. The item will then jump back to the old position.
- A kanban implementation of an issue tracking system shows columns that indicate different phases in handling issues (such as new / processed / done / closed). There is no screen space outside the kanban columns. Users can pick up and move icons representing issues between columns. When an item has been dropped in another column, the action can be reversed by dragging the icon back to the original column where it will return to its original position (defined by sorting preferences).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For content that is draggable, check whether the drag-and-drop action can be reversed by:

				

1. releasing the picked-up item outside a drop target
2. dragging the picked-up item back to its old position
3. a confirmation dialog or an undo control appears after the item has been dropped

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- At least one option of #1, #2, #3 is true

### G211: Matching the accessible name to the visible label <a id="g211"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that speech input users can operate web content reliably while not adversely affecting other users of assistive technology.

			

When speech input users interact with a web page, they usually speak a command followed by the reference to some visible label (such as text beside an input field or inside a button or link). For example, they may say "click search" to activate a button labelled Search. When speech recognition software processes speech input and looks for matches, it uses the [ accessible name](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/) of controls. Where there is a mismatch between the text in the label and the text in the accessible name, it can cause issues for the user. The simplest way to enable speech input users and meet 2.5.3 Label in Name is to ensure that the accessible name matches the visible text label.

			

##### Determining the appropriate label

			

Sometimes more than one text string will be positioned in the vicinity of a control that could be considered a candidate for its label. For example, a set of inputs that each have their own labels may also be preceded by a heading, an instruction or a group label (such as an HTML legend/fieldset or an ARIA group or radiogroup). Note that the term "group label" means something different than "label", both programmatically and in regard to 2.5.3 Label in Name.

			

The [Understanding 2.5.3 Label in Name document](../../Understanding/label-in-name) recommends that only the text string adjacent to or in close proximity to an input should be treated as the label when assessing a control's label for the purposes of meeting 2.5.3 (see the section "Identifying label text for components"). There are both practical and technical reasons for restricting the designation of an input's label in this way. The technical reasons are discussed in the Understanding document's section called Accessible Name and Description Computation specification.

#### Examples
Mapping a visible label to the accessible name is achieved in many technologies by meeting [ 1.3.1 Information and Relationships](../../Understanding/info-and-relationships.html) through the proper use of native semantics. Many controls derive accessible names by correct nesting of elements, while other elements have specific attributes which are a valid means of providing or referencing an accessible name.

			

The accessible name should be assigned through native elements and semantics where possible. That helps ensure an exact match between the visible label and name.

			

			

##### Anchor text provides both the link's label and its accessible name

			

Using conventional HTML, the text between the `a` element's tags provides both the link's visible text and the accessible name "Code of conduct":

		
			
```html
<p>Go to our <a href="url-to-page-about-code.html">Code of conduct</a></p>
```

				

			

###### Non-working sample of anchor

			

Go to our [Code of conduct](#linksample)

				

			

				

		

##### Text in label element provides name for input via for attribute

		

The text between the `label` tags also serves as the checkbox input's accessible name "Notify me of delays" by using the `for` attribute which references the `id` of the `input`.

	

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="notification" name="notify" value="delays">
<label for="notification">Notify me of delays</label>
```

      

      	

###### Working sample of input

      	
  			Notify me of delays
      

	

	
		

			
		

##### The button text provides the accessible name

		

The text inside a `button` element becomes both its visible label and its accessible name:

	
		
```html
<button>Send</button>
```

    

  		

###### Non-working sample of button

  		Send
    

	

	
			
			

				

##### Simple Radio Button Group

				

Radio buttons typically appear in a group, where each button is labelled and the group of buttons is preceded by information which explains or categorizes the group.

				
					
					Figure 1 "Call me when balance exceeds $10,000 radio group, with Yes and No choices
				
				

The label for each component should be restricted to "Yes" and "No". To meet [ 1.3.1 Information and Relationships](../../Understanding/info-and-relationships) and [ 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](../../Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html), the "Call me…" text can be coded to convey the relationship to ATs, in this example by using a `fieldset` and `legend`.

				

If the label is not restricted to the string adjacent to the radio button, multiple interpretations of what constitutes the label can result in less uniform functionality. If "Yes" alone is not the label for the first radio button, is it "Call me when balance exceeds $10,000"? Or is it a combination of text strings, in which case is the order "Call me when balance exceeds $10,000 Yes" or "Yes, Call me when balance exceeds $10,000"? Decisions to combine text strings can have negative effects on screen reader users since the order of concatenation can affect meaning. In this example, "No, call me when balance exceeds $10,000" could be very confusing to a screen reader user.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Call me when balance exceeds $10,000?</legend><br />
  <input type="radio" id="yes" name="callme" value="yes">
  <label for="yes">Yes</label>
  <input type="radio" id="no" name="callme" value="no">
  <label for="no">No</label>
</fieldset>
```

				

[Working example of Simple Radio Button Group](../../working-examples/label-in-name-general/example1.html)

			

			

				

##### Checkbox Groupings

				

For checkbox groupings, implementations that attempt to incorporate more than just the immediate checkbox label into the accessible name can also be problematic if not isolated to the adjacent text string.

				
					
					Figure 2 What do you value in our service? checkbox group, with 4 choices.
				
				
				

In Figure 2, there is a long text string that combines a group label and instruction, "What do you value in our service (check all that apply)?" Each of the checkboxes also has its own one- or two-word label. In regard to 2.5.3, the labels for the components should be restricted to "Courtesy", "Promptness", "Store Hours" and "Knowledge".

				

Attempting to include the preceding text as part of the accessible name can potentially make it more difficult to isolate a control by spoken commands for speech-input users. Such a construction will also negatively increase verbosity for screen reader users (with the combined text strings read out for each of the inputs before the input's state). The simplest solution is to restrict the accessible name to the text immediately beside the checkboxes, using similar techniques to those for the standard radio button group.

		

					

				

##### Stacked Labels

				

Although labels for comboboxes, dropdown lists, text inputs, and other widgets are typically oriented immediately to the left of the component, there is an alternative established convention where labels are stacked above the inputs, aligned with their left edge.

				

					

					Figure 3 Two inputs with the labels positioned above and to the left.
				
				
				

In Figure 3, the inputs are stacked and left-aligned, with the labels immediately preceding each input, also left-aligned. There is additional white space between the label and the preceding input so that the label is closest to its associated text input. Stacked labels are relatively common in mobile designs, where horizontal space is constrained.

				

Figure 4 shows a variation on stacked labels, where hints and guidance are included between the label and the input. This design does not provide an adjacent label. However, the "New Password" label is still considered to be in close enough proximity, especially given its size and boldness relative to the smaller and lower-contrast guidance text. The associations are reinforced programmatically, where the hint text is given a role of `aria-describedby` and the label is properly associated with the input.

								
					
					Figure 4 "New password" label positioned above input with a smaller-point text string about the password requirements positioned between the large label and the input.
				
				

The hint text in such implementations should be kept to a single line where possible, since accessibility issues can arise where a more lengthy hint separates the label from its input. Figure 4 illustrates that the concept of "adjacent text" is a guide for label interpretation, but cannot always serve as a hard rule.

```html
<form>
  <label class="label" for="example-2">New password</label>
  <span id="example-2-hint" class="hint">
    Passwords must be 10 or more characters, and contain at least one capital, numeric and non-alphanumeric.
  </span>
  <input class="input" id="example-2" name="example-2" type="password"
         autocomplete="new-password" aria-describedby="example-2-hint">
</form>
```

				

[Working example of stacked labels](../../working-examples/label-in-name-general/example2.html)

		

					

				

##### Range of inputs with few labels

				

A less common disparity between labels and inputs can occur when a group of radio buttons is set up to elicit a choice across a range. The labels may only be located at each end of the range or may be interspersed at various points in the range.

				
					
					Figure 5 Line of 5 radio buttons with Hated it and Loved it labels at each end
				
				
				

The two labels, "Hated it" and "Loved it", are adjacent to the first and last radio buttons, and should be their accessible names. Speech-input users can speak either of these labels to select a radio button, and then use arrow navigation (e.g., "Press right arrow") to modify the selection. "Rate your response" is the text describing the whole widget and can be associated as the group label (here using `legend`). The three middle radio buttons do not have visible labels. In the code example they are given title attributes of "Disliked", "So-so" and "Liked" in order to meet 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Rate your response</legend>
  <label for="hated">Hated it</label>
  <input type="radio" name="meal" id="hated" value="hated">
  <input type="radio" name="meal" id="poor" value="poor" title="Disliked">
  <input type="radio" name="meal" id="neutral" value="neutral" title="So-so">
  <input type="radio" name="meal" id="okay" value="okay" title="Liked">
  <input type="radio" name="meal" id="loved" value="loved">
  <label for="loved">Loved it</label>
</fieldset>
```

##### Text in parentheses and punctuation

			

Technique G211 is not intended to complicate existing conventions for the construction of accessible form inputs. As described in the *Punctuation and capitalization* and *Text in parentheses* subsections of the Understanding document, information does not always need to be included in the accessible name in an attempt to meet the Label in Name requirement, especially where the text would not normally be spoken when using speech recognition to navigate to controls. Where there are established ways of ensuring information and relationships conveyed visually are present programmatically, it is acceptable to leave text in parentheses and punctuation out of the accessible name.

			

The following snippet demonstrates possible techniques mentioned in the Understanding document. Since the required field is programmatically indicated, and the input restrictions on the date are surfaced through `aria-describedby`, the asterisk and parenthetical information has been left out of the accessible name.

			
				
				Figure 6 The "Name" and "Birth date" labels with additional information (and asterisk and an input formatting instruction, respectively)
			

```html
<label for="name">Name</label> *
<input type="text" name="name" id="name" autocomplete="name" required>
<label for="birth">Birth date</label> (<span id="mask">YYYY-MM-DD</span>)
<input type="text" name="birth" id="birth" autocomplete="bday" aria-describedby="mask">
```

			

[Working example of inputs with simplified accessible names](../../working-examples/label-in-name-general/example3.html)

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

1. For input controls, examine each input that has adjacent text which serves as its label
2. For each input, check that the label's entire string of text (optionally disregarding letter case, punctuation, and information in parentheses) matches the accessible name for the input, according to the accessible name computation
3. For buttons, links, menus and other non-input controls, examine each control that contains text which serves as its label
4. For each non-input control, check that the label's entire string of text (optionally disregarding letter case, punctuation and information in parentheses) matches the accessible name for the input

### G212: Using native controls to ensure functionality is triggered on the up-event. <a id="g212"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who attempt to interact with a control do not trigger the action of the event accidentally. This can be accomplished most directly by relying on the pointer's up-event (for example, the onclick or mouseup event).

      		

The easiest way to meet this success criterion is simply to use the default behavior of controls and not override that behavior with an explicit down-event trigger. The up-event is the default behavior for almost all controls and any programming or markup language.

     		

In native languages where a control is fired on the down event it is usually for good reason and is easily recoverable. For instance, an HTML input element could have the cursor enter the editable area on the “pointer down” event, because the action is trivially reversible, and as such meets the requirements of the Pointer Cancellation SC. This is because if the user realizes they made a mistake after pressing down the control, they can simply move their pointer away from the hit area while still holding down the pointer, then release their pointer and the event is not triggered.

#### Examples
##### Using an native onclick event in JavaScript

				

In JavaScript native onclick events are triggered on the up-event by default.

			

      		

				

##### Using a native button or link in HTML

				

In HTML native `<button>` or `<a href ....>` onclick events are triggered on the up-event by default.

				

The `<button>` element doesn't do anything on its own (unless its part of a `<form>`, and does NOT have `<type="button">`, in which case it submits the form). Authors should rely on input-agnostic click handlers.

				
			

			

				

##### Using a native button in iOS or Android

				

In native buttons in iOS and Android onclick events are triggered on the up-event by default.

				

The WCAG standard itself applies to [web pages](), and therefore this example is provided as helpful supplementary advice for those looking to implement the [WCAG2ICT](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/) for native applications.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For all clickable controls:

				

1. Activate the down-event then move the pointer outside the target before triggering the up-event, and then release the pointer to trigger the up-event.
2. Check that the action was not triggered when the pointer is released outside of the hit area for the target.
3. If the action is triggered, check that the action is reversible.

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- Check #2 or #3 is true.

### G213: Provide conventional controls and an application setting for motion activated input <a id="g213"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that:

			

1. People who use mounted devices or who cannot precisely manipulate a device are able to provide inputs through more conventional user interface components, and
2. People who may accidentally activate sensors due to tremors or other motor impairments have the ability to turn off motion actuation to prevent such accidental triggering of functions.

			
			

When a device sensor such as an accelerometer or gyroscope is used to gather input:

			

1. A button, link, or other conventional control is provided that does not rely on sensor input, and
2. A setting is provided to allow the user to turn off the sensor data.

#### Examples
##### Shake to undo

				

After text is entered in a field, shaking a device shows a dialog offering users to undo the entry. Supporting use of the backspace key and/or providing a clear button next to the text field offers the same functionality.

				

Shake to undo can be turned off in a settings page.

			

			

				

##### Motion Activated Slider

				

A slider can be adjusted by tipping the device to the left and right. There are also buttons to achieve the same functionality, and a tick-box that prevents the motion from having an effect.

				

Working example of a [slider with motion actuation](../../working-examples/device-motion-sensor-input/).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For each input that performs a function in response to a motion sensor:

				

1. Check that there is a mechanism to perform the same function that does not rely on a sensor.
2. Check that there is a user setting which disables the motion detection.

			

			

       

##### Expected Results

 			 

- Check #1 and #2 are true.

### G214: Using a control to allow access to content in different orientations which is otherwise restricted <a id="g214"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow users to access content in the way the user prefers. A content provider may expect that most users will view content using a specific device orientation or may expect that a user will want to maintain the original view within the device. As a result the provider then prevents the content from rotating. By providing a control to allow the user to rotate the content, someone who needs to use a particular orientation will be able to view the content in a comfortable manner. For example, a person who cannot hold the device and has it mounted attached to a wheelchair or bed.

      

Many users will expect to use OS-level settings to prevent the orientation from changing. As a result, it is usually preferable to satisfy this success criterion by not restricting the content's ability to adapt to changes in orientation and allowing users to use the OS orientation lock when desired.

#### Examples
##### An e-Reader application

        

Users of an e-Reader web application sometimes read when lying down on their side. In this situation, the device is viewed by the user in portrait mode even though the device is in the landscape orientation with regard to gravity. The developer locks the content into the portrait orientation to allow for this reading behavior, but also provides a control to allow users who have devices mounted in a specific orientation to achieve the desired viewing orientation.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

        

For content that does not change orientation when the device is rotated:

        

1. Check for a control within the user interface to change the orientation of the content.
2. Check that when the control is operated that the content changes orientation.

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- Checks #1 and #2 are true.

### G215: Providing controls to achieve the same result as path based or multipoint gestures <a id="g215"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who have difficulties performing path-based gestures can operate a content slider with a single pointer (e.g., a single tap on a touch screen or a single mouse click). A content slider contains chunks of content in a row. Usually several chunks of content are hidden, and only one chunk is visible at any time. Left and right horizontal swiping over the visible part of the slider brings adjacent hidden chunks of content into view. Providing controls (for example, arrow buttons) as alternative means of input allows advancing the slider with single pointer input.

			

On touch screen devices, author-supplied path-based gestures usually do not work when OS level assistive technologies (AT) like a built-in screenreader are turned on. This is because AT generally consumes a path-based gestures so they would not reach the authored content. For example, a horizontal swipe gesture over the content slider will not work as intended by the author, but move the screen reader focus to the next or previous element. Some gestures may work if the user operates "pass-through gestures" which are often unreliable as they may depend on factors of hardware, operating system, operating system "skin", operating system setting, or user agent.

			

This technique addresses gestures where support has been implemented by authors, not gestures provided by the user agent (such as horizontal swiping to move through the browser history or vertical swiping to scroll through page content) or the operating system (e.g., gestures to move between open apps, or call up contextual menus of assistive technologies when these are enabled).

#### Examples
- A content slider allows users to swipe left and right to reveal adjacent chunks of content. There are also next and previous buttons that enable users to advance to the next or previous chunks of content.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

		

For content sliders that respond to path-based gestures:

		

1. Check that single pointer operable controls exist over or adjacent to the content slider that advance to adjacent chunks of content.

		

		

		

##### Expected Results

		

- #1 is true

### G216: Providing single point activation for a control slider <a id="g216"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who have difficulties performing path-based gestures can operate a control slider. A control slider is a track with a "thumb" that you move along the track to set a value.

			
				
				Screenshot of an example control slider showing the thumb in the middle of the track.
			
			
			

It allows a user to set a value in a certain range, e.g. setting the volume, changing the hue value of a color, putting in the amount of money needed in a loan calculator, or picking a sum to be donated to a charity. A slider that requires path-based gestures would use swiping left or right to change the value, or dragging the thumb of the slider in a specific direction to change the value.

        	

A simple fallback for activation without a path-based gesture is to make the control slider track clickable. This way, a value can be specified using a single tap or click on the track.

     		

Providing controls (e.g., arrow buttons) as alternative also allows incrementing or decrementing the value with taps or clicks. This can allow for a more fine-grained setting of the value.

		
      		

On touch screen devices, author-supplied path-based gestures usually do not work when an OS level Assistive Technology (AT) like a built-in screenreader are turned on. This is because AT generally consumes path-based gestures so they would not reach the authored content. When custom controls are built on top of native controls, however, these may also be operable with AT gestures such as vertical swiping to change the value (see example 1).

#### Examples
A custom control slider built on top of a native slider ([input type range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range)) allows users to swipe left and right or drag the slider thumb to change the value of the slider. The slider track allows tapping or clicking to set the slider thumb to the activated position. Standard buttons on either side allow for incrementing and decrementing the slider value by tap, click or keyboard activation.

  			

[Working example of custom control slider](../../working-examples/providing-single-point-control-slider/)

#### Tests
##### Procedure

		

For each control slider that responds to path-based gestures:

		

1. Check that the value of the control slider (range) can be set with a tap or click using a pointer.

		

		

		

##### Expected Results

		

- Check #1 is true

### G217: Providing a mechanism to allow users to remap or turn off character key shortcuts <a id="g217"></a>

#### Description
Some authors provide shortcuts in their applications to allow for faster user interaction. However, where such shortcuts involve only character keys (letters, numbers, punctuation or symbol characters) without modifiers, they create challenges for speech input users as well as some keyboard users who lack the ability to type accurately.

			

To prevent accidental activation, authors must allow users to turn off or reconfigure shortcuts that are made up of only character keys. Reconfiguring the shortcut may involve the ability to add a modifier key such as Ctrl, or authors may elect to allow users to alter the character keys assigned in addition to adding a modifer. Providing a mechanism to turn off or reassign the shortcut ensures more users can successfully interact with the application.

			

If the keyboard shortcut is only active when a particular user interface component has focus, then the author does not need to provide an override mechanism. For example, in a `select` element, it is expected behavior that pressing a letter key will reposition to the next item within the select element that begins with that character. This shortcut is only triggered when the select element has focus, and so it does not interfere with a user's ability to interact with the rest of the page.

			

##### Locating and testing for character key shortcuts

			

An initial challenge for testers is identifying if author-created shortcuts exist, and then determining if existing shortcuts are triggered by character keys without modifiers. Where testers have access to the develop team, the existence and nature of shortcut keys can often be determined simply by asking involved designers and developers. Where reliable information from the authors is not available, the presence of shortcuts can possibly be identified by checking code (for example, in javascript, the presence of `keydown`, `keyup` and `keypress` listeners). Another means of identifying shortcuts is to review documentation. Where none of these strategies provide information on the presence of keyboard shortcuts, manual tests will need to be completed to search for the existence of character key shortcuts. Review the test procedure in [failure technique F99](../failures/F99) for guidance.

#### Examples
##### Author provides a simple mechanism to disable shortcuts in a web-based email client

				

An email client contains single-character shortcuts so that keyboard users can more rapidly interact with the application (e.g., the R key replies to the current item in the inbox, the D key deletes it, the S key stars it). These keys do not apply while users are composing emails; however, users may become confused about whether the keyboard focus is in a compose pane or the inbox and, while in the inbox, inadvertently delete a message by trying to compose a word containing the letter D. To overcome this problem, the author provides a toggle button for the shortcuts, allowing users to easily turn them off or on.

			

			

				

##### Author provides a menu option where users can remap shortcuts

				

A web-based application has single-character shortcuts for functions which are different than those a user regularly uses with a software application installed locally. Since the author has provided a menu where the user can reassign both the shortcut keys and the modifiers, the user is able to reassign the shortcut to a familiar combination.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For each character key shortcut:

				

1. Determine if the user has the ability either to turn off the shortcut or to remap it to a combination that includes one or more modifier keys.

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- #1 is true.

### G218: Email link authentication <a id="g218"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide an easy way for users to authenticate without needing a password. This technique involves providing an authentication mechanism where the user can enter their email address, and they are sent an email with a link to click. When the user clicks the link in the email, they are directed back to the website and automatically logged in.

			

The security of the email link mechanism is not the focus of this technique, but it generally involves sending a time limited token as part of the email.

#### Examples
##### Author provides an email mechanism to login with a link

				

A social media website has a username and password based login mechanism. As part of the forgotten password feature, there is a separate link to login with an email. When the user enters their email and submits the form, the site sends an email to the user. Clicking the link in the email opens  the website and the user is logged in.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For websites which allow users to login by emailing a link to the email address associated with the account:

				

1. Enter a valid email address (with an account on the website) and use the email-link feature.
2. Check that the email is received.
3. Check that selecting the link opens the website.
4. Check that the user account is logged in.
5. Check that no object recognition test is used as part of the authentication process.

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- #2, #3 and #4 are true.
- For the AAA Accessible Authentication (Enhanced), #5 is also true.

### G219: Ensuring that an alternative is available for dragging movements that operate on content <a id="g219"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this Technique is to ensure that people with motor impairments who cannot carry out [dragging movements]() are presented with an alternative [single pointer]() interaction that does not involve dragging.

 
      

Some direct manipulation interfaces allow users to pick up targets and use dragging movements to move them to another position, for example, to change the position of an item in a priority list, or to move a task on a Kanban or planning board.

      

Such dragging movements are difficult or impossible to carry out for some users with motor disabilities. The alternative to dragging movements operates the underlying function by one or several [single pointer]() activations that don't require dragging. A single tap or click may reveal controls (arrows) to move a target in a stepwise fashion; open a drop-down menu where the drop position can be selected; or allow moving it to an adjacent postion by a swipe gesture.

#### Examples
- A list of items can be re-ordered by picking up an item and dragging it upwards or downwards. Other elements move dynamically to open a gap where the picked-up target can be dropped. After a single pointer activation, the list items display up and down arrows which allow a step-wise re-ordering of the list via [single pointer]() inputs (taps or clicks at the up or down arrow).
- A vertical priority list indicates the priority of items listed. Each item can be ‘picked up’ with a pointer and dragged up or down to another position. The other list items rearrange dynamically. To the left of each list item, a number in a text field shows the current priority position. For any of the items, users can put in another number. This leads to a dynamic reordering and renumbering of the priority list.
- In a Kanban implementation for process management, tasks can be dragged horizontally from one ‘swimming lane’ to another in order to change the status of tasks (for example, to change the status of a task from “in process” to “completed”). One or several items in a lane can be selected by a single tap or click. A single pointer activation of a drop-down menu labelled “Move selected items to” offers a selection of drop targets (other lanes). A further single pointer activation over the desired menu item moves targets to the specified lane.
- In a radial control widget, the visual indicator of the current value of the control can be dragged to a different position. Users can also click or tap on another position of the radial control to change the value.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For interface elements that support dragging:

				

1. Check the interface for the presence of functions triggered by [dragging movement]()s.
2. Check that there is a [single pointer]() activation alternative that does not require dragging to operate the same function

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- Check #2 is true.

### G220: Provide a contact-us link in a consistent location <a id="g220"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for finding contact details in a consistent location across pages to make it easier for users to find it. The interactive item in the web page is a link to the contact details page. The programmatic and visual location is consistent on each page in the set of web pages, when viewed within the same size viewport. Activating the link brings users to a web page with contact details such as a phone number and/or email address.

#### Examples
##### A link at the top of the page

				

An on-line job application asks for many types of information from the user, such as their identification number, but they may have several and not know which one to enter. They may need more information from someone that can answer their question when the contextual help provided does not meet their needs. One of the first links that the user reaches when tabbing through the page is titled "Contact Us". This link is also visually in the same location on each page. Activating the link brings the user to the contact details page. The contact details page has an email address for a company representative or general information inbox which is then shared with appropriate personnel.

			

			

				

##### A link in the footer region

				

A web page's footer region contains links repeated on every page in a set of web pages. The visual and programmatic order are consistent when viewed in the same size display. One of the first links in the footer region is labeled visually and programmatically "Contact Us". A user activates the link and is brought to the contact details page. The contact details page has an email address for a company representative or general information inbox which is then shared with appropriate personnel.

			

			

				

##### A link sometimes in a disclosure widget

				

On some pages in a set of web pages, there is a link to a help mechanism directly on the page. On one or more other pages in the set, the link is within a disclosure widget which is in the same relative order as the link that is directly on the page.

        

> **Note:**
> >           
> 
> Although this example technically passes the Success Criterion, it creates a less consistent user experience and is less preferable than consistently placing a link directly on the page.
> 
> 
>

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

1. Determine if this is a set of web pages with blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages.
2. Determine if at least one of the following is included or linked in a consistent location:
						

- Human contact details
- Human contact mechanism
- Self-help option
- A fully automated mechanism
3. Without changing the viewport size, check that the identified help is present on all other web pages within that set of web pages.

### G221: Provide data from a previous step in a process <a id="g221"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide information that was previously provided by the user or by the system, rather than requiring the user to remember and re-enter the information from a previous step. This improves success for individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities and memory impairments.

#### Examples
##### Populate previously entered information with a trigger

				

An e-commerce site provides a checkbox that triggers the shipping address to be pre-populated based on the billing address the user had entered in a previous step.

			

			

				

##### Automatically populate information based on previous answers

				

During a two-step process for setting up a business, the first step provides a business identification number after the user enters a name, and address. The second step requires creating a user profile. The business identification number, name and address are prepopulated.

            

            

				

##### Display the information from a previous step

				

During a two-step process for setting up a business, the first step provides a business identification number after the user enters a name and address. The second step requires creating a user profile. The interface allows the user to select the business they just set up with all associated information.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

For each input in a process that requires information to be entered:

				

1. Check if the information has already been requested on a previous step of the process;
2. Check that the information entered previously is prepopulated in the fields or displayed on the page.

### G224: Accounting for meaningful text indentation and Reflow <a id="g224"></a>

#### Description
There can be instances where indentation of text is considered important to the presentation and understandability of the text content. If the indentations were to be removed, then meaning or functionality could suffer. For instance, the nesting of unordered lists can be harder to notice if indentations are removed. Additionally, maintaining indentations can be important to help understand code patterns, if not even necessary for the code to function.

      

Since maintaining indentation is important for these instances of text, two-dimensional scrolling of these distinct sections of content could be necessary. However, there are still styling modifications that could be made to help ensure the indentation was maintained, but as much text was made visible within the viewport as possible. Making such adjustments could limit, if not mitigate any two-dimensional scrolling from occurring, making the content easier for people to read.

#### Examples
A website conveys information in a nested list format. The understandability of the list hierarchy is supported by the indentation of the list content. While it is important for the individual list item text to reflow, the list hierarchy would suffer if flattened so that all content would fit within a 320 CSS pixel wide viewport.

  
        

The following example list contains additional nested lists to provide more context for each of the parent list item's text. To maintain the visual hierarchy, the indentation of each list level remains present, but modified once an author defined CSS breakpoint is met. Additional styles are set for different breakpoints to mitigate against the potential for content to extend beyond a 320px wide viewport, while accounting for visual spacing against the borders of the viewport, to attempt to make the content not feel cramped. At the smallest breakpoint, the content of list items receive a minimum width to mitigate against potentially "squished" content lists with many nested levels. At this breakpoint, each nested list level can be horizontally scrolled into view, and once a nested list is visible within the viewport, only vertical scrolling will be necessary to read the content of the nested list's items.

```html

<div class="example">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Make a list using one of the HTML list elements, or even an ARIA <code>role=list</code> container.</p>
			<ul>

A working example of [a list where nested levels can be read within a 320px wide viewport](../../working-examples/reflow-nested-lists).

      

      
      

        

A website providing code snippets needs to maintain line indentations, as the indentations are meaningful not only to the structure of the code, but in some languages - such as with Python, are requirements when defining blocks of code.

        

As a user zooms in the web page, the CSS of the indentation can be adjusted to maintain this necessary structure, while also allowing more text to be visible on a single line.

        

The following represents a Python code example. The indentation of each line of text is necessary to create a group of statements that are executed as a block.

```python

def complex_function(x):
    if x > 0:
        for i in range(x):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                print(f"{i} is even")
                for a in range(i):
                    if a % 5 == 0:
                        print(f"  {a} can be divided by 5")
                    else:
                        print(f"  {a} cannot be divided by 5")
            else:
                print(f"{i} is odd")
                for a in range(i):
                    if a % 2 == 0:
                        print(f"  {a} is even")
                    else:
                        print(f"  {a} is odd")
    else:
        print("x is not a positive number")

```

        

The following code example demonstrates the use of indentation to convey the nesting of elements in an HTML document:

```html

<html lang=en>
	<head>...</head>
	<body>
		<div>
			<!-- ... keep indenting as necessary  -->
		</div>
	</body>
</html>

```
     
        

The indentation of code blocks like these could be adjusted at different viewport sizes, via a CSS Media Query.

```css

@media screen and ( min-width: 320px ) {
	pre {
		tab-size: 8px;
	}
}

@media screen and ( min-width: 640px ) {
	pre {
		tab-size: 16px;
	}
}

@media screen and ( min-width: 1280px ) {
	pre {
		tab-size: 32px;
	}
}

```

#### Tests
##### Procedure for list example

         

1. Display the web page in a user agent where the page can be zoomed, or the user agent can be resized.
2. Zoom in or resize the browser window so that the viewport is equivalent to 320 CSS pixels wide.
3. The list content fits within the width so that it is only necessary so scroll vertically to read the list.
4. Or, each nested list can be horizontally scrolled into view. Only vertical scrolling is necessary to read the content of list items within each specific nested list level.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks 3 or 4 are true.

      

      

##### Procedure for code snippets

         

1. Display the web page in a user agent where the page can be zoomed, or the user agent can be resized.
2. Zoom in or resize the browser window so that the viewport is equivalent to 320 CSS pixels wide.
3. The code snippets fits within the width so that it is only necessary so scroll vertically to read each line of code.
4. Or, for code where non-wrapping lines are not essential, the code wraps or a mechanism is provided to allow line wrapping.
5. Or, the indentation and linebreaks are meaningful to the code language.

### G225: Section panels that scroll horizontally are designed to fit within a width of 320 CSS pixels on a vertically scrolling page <a id="g225"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to ensure that users can zoom in on text within a horizontally scrolling section, while not requiring horizontal scrolling to read the content of each individual panel. Although the entire section requires horizontal scrolling to navigate between panels, each panel is designed to fit within a fixed width of 320 CSS pixels. This ensures that when a 320 CSS pixel wide viewport is used, and the card is in the viewport, each card will remain fully visible without the need for additional horizontal scrolling to read its content.

#### Examples
##### A product carousel

             

The homepage of an online retail website includes several informational sections, some of which feature carousels showcasing highlighted products. These carousels require horizontal scrolling and have a computed height greater than 256 CSS pixels. Each panel is 320 CSS pixels wide, allowing users to see the full width of the card without horizontal scrolling. Consequently, users only need to scroll vertically to view the entire card, ensuring compliance with Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow for that section.

             

Working example: [Carousel panels that scroll horizontally are designed to fit within a width of 320 CSS pixels on a vertically scrolling page](../../working-examples/reflow-carousel-panel-horizontal-scroll/).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

            

1. Check that the layout includes sections of content that scroll horizontally within a vertically scrolling page.
2. Check that each horizontally scrolling section is divided into distinct panels.
3. Open the webpage in a user agent that supports 400% zoom, setting the viewport dimensions to 1280 CSS pixels in width.
4. Activate the zoom function to enlarge the view by 400%.
5. Check that the content of each individual panel within the horizontally scrolling sections is fully readable without the need for additional horizontal scrolling.

            

The native browser scrollbar is not included in the viewport dimensions. Therefore, when setting the view to 1280 CSS pixels wide for a vertically scrolling page, make sure to exclude the scrollbar width.

         

         

            

##### Expected Results

            

- All checks above are true.

### H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource <a id="h2"></a>

#### Description
This objective of this technique is to provide both text and iconic representations of links without making the web page more confusing or difficult for keyboard users or assistive technology users. Since different users finding text and icons more usable, providing both can improve the accessibility of the link.

      

Many links have both a text and iconic representation adjacent to each other, but rendered in separate `a` elements. Visually they appear to be a single link, but many users encounter them as adjacent identical links. For a keyboard user, it is tedious to navigate through redundant links. For users of assistive technologies, it can be confusing to encounter successive identical links. When the text alternative for the icon is a duplicate of the link text, it is repetitive as screen readers read the description twice.

 
      

If the author omitted alternative text from the link image, it would fail [Success Criterion 1.1.1](../../understanding/20/non-text-content.html) because the text alternative would not serve the same purpose as the graphical link.

 
      

This technique provides such links by putting the text and image together in one `a` element and providing null alternative text on the image to eliminate duplication of text. In this way, both representations of the link are provided, but keyboard users only encounter one link and assistive technology that provides users with link lists for a web page do not include duplicate links.

      

Sometimes the text and the icon link are rendered in separate, adjacent table cells to facilitate page layout. Although WCAG 2 does not prohibit the use of layout tables, CSS-based layouts are recommended in order to retain the defined semantic meaning of the HTML table elements and to conform to the coding practice of separating presentation from content. If CSS is used, this technique can be applied to combine the links.

#### Examples
The icon and text are contained in the same `a` element.

         

```html
<a href="products.html">
  <img src="icon.gif" alt="">Products page
</a>
```

      

      

         

A link contains an icon and text, and the site help refers to the icon. The `img` has a text alternative which is the name used for the icon in the site help, which describes clicking the home page icon.

         

```html
<a href="home.html">
  <img src="house.gif" alt="home page icon">Go to the home page
</a>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each `a` applying this technique:

         

1. Check that every `img` element contained within the `a` element has a null value set for its `alt` attribute.
2. Check that the `a` element contains an `img` element that has either a null `alt` attribute value or a value that supplements the link text and describes the image

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- All checks above are true.

### H24: Providing text alternatives for the area elements of image maps <a id="h24"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide text alternatives that serve the same
            purpose as the selectable regions of an image map. An image map is an image divided into
            selectable regions defined by `area` elements. Each area is a link to another
            web page or another part of the current web page. The `alt` attribute of each
              `area` element serves the same purpose as the selectable area of the
          image.

#### Examples
This example uses the `alt` attribute of the `area` element to provide text that describes the purpose of the image map areas.

         

```html
<img src="welcome.gif" usemap="#map1" 
     alt="Areas in the library. Select an area for more information on that area."> 
<map id="map1" name="map1">
  <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,30,30" href="reference.html" alt="Reference">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,34,100,100" href="media.html" alt="Audio visual lab">
</map>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each `area` element in an image map:

         

1. Check that the `area` element has an `alt` attribute.
2. Check that the text alternative specified by the `alt` attribute serves the same
                  purpose as the part of image map image referenced by the `area` element
                  of the image map.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- The above checks are true.

### H30: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link for anchor elements <a id="h30"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to describe the purpose of a link by providing descriptive text as the content of the `a` element. The description lets a user distinguish this link from other links in the web page and helps the user determine whether to follow the link. The URI of the destination is generally not sufficiently descriptive.

      

When an image is the only content of a link, the text alternative for the image describes the unique function of the link.

      

When the content of a link contains both text and one or more images, if the text is sufficient to describe the purpose of the link, the images may have an empty text alternative. (See [Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that assistive technology should ignore](H67).) When the images convey information beyond the purpose of the link, they must also have appropriate alt text.

#### Examples
Describing the purpose of a link in HTML in the text content of the `a` element.

         

```html
<a href="routes.html">
  Current routes at Boulders Climbing Gym
</a>
```

		

    

			

Using the `alt` attribute for the `img` element to describe the purpose of a graphical link.

         

```html
<a href="routes.html">
  <img src="topo.gif" alt="Current routes at Boulders Climbing Gym"> 
</a>
```

    

    

			

Using an empty `alt` attribute when the anchor (`a`) element contains text that describes the purpose of the link in addition to the `img` element. Note that the link text will appear on the page next to the image.

         

```html
<a href="routes.html">
  <img src="topo.gif" alt="">
  Current routes at Boulders Climbing Gym
</a>
```

    

    

			

A site allows users to provide feedback on products by clicking on the "Feedback" link in a product detail page. Other users are able to provide a response to any feedback. When a response to the user's feedback is available, the feedback link displays an icon, with "response received" as its text alternative, after the "Feedback" text. The site's help document describes this icon as a speech bubble containing quotation marks and includes the icon, with its text alternative, as an example. The same text alternative is used in the product detail pages (when a response is available) to help ensure that users following the documentation can identify the image correctly as documented.

         

```html
<a href="prod_123_feedback.html">
  Feedback 
  <img src="response.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="response received">
</a>
```

		

    

			

A link contains text and an icon, and the icon provides additional information about the target.

         

```html
<a href="WMFP.pdf">
  Woodend Music Festival Program
  <img src="pdficon.gif" alt="PDF format">
</a>
```

  </li>		
</ul>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

		

For each link in the content that uses this technique:

		

1. Check that text or a text alternative for non-text content is included in the
							`a` element.
2. If an `img` element is the only content of the `a` element,
						check that its text alternative describes the purpose of the link.
3. If the `a` element contains one or more `img` element(s)
						and the text alternative of the `img` element(s) is empty, check that the text of the link describes the purpose of the link.
4. If the `a` element only contains text, check that the text describes
						the purpose of the link.

### H36: Using alt attributes on images used as submit buttons <a id="h36"></a>

#### Description
For input elements of type `image`, the `alt` attribute of the `input` element is used to provide a functional label. This label indicates the button's function, but does not attempt to describe the image. The label is especially important if there are multiple submit buttons on the page that each lead to different results.

#### Examples
##### An input element with an alt attribute

         

```html
<form action="/find" method="post" role="search">
  <label for="look-up">Find books<label>
  <input id="look-up" type="text">
  <input alt="Search" src="button.gif" type="image">
</form>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. For all `input` elements that have a type attribute value of `image`, check for the presence of an `alt` attribute.
2. Check that the value of the `alt` attribute describes the button's function.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- #1 and #2 are true

### H37: Using alt attributes on img elements <a id="h37"></a>

#### Description
When using the `img` element, specify a short text alternative with the
            `alt` attribute. Note. The value of this attribute is referred to as "alt
            text".

      

When an image contains words that are important to understanding the content, the alt
            text should include those words. This will allow the alt text to play the same function
            on the page as the image. Note that it does not necessarily describe the visual
            characteristics of the image itself but must convey the same meaning as the image.

#### Examples
An image on a Website provides a link to a free newsletter. The image contains the
                text "Free newsletter. Get free recipes, news, and more. Learn more." The alt text
                matches the text in the image.

```html
<img src="newsletter.gif" alt="Free newsletter. 
 Get free recipes, news, and more. Learn more.">
```

      

      

      	

An image on a website depicts the floor plan of a building. The image is an
              image map with each room an interactive map area. The alt text is "The
              building's floor plan. Select a room for more information about the purpose or
              content of the room." The instruction to "select a room" indicates that the
              image is interactive.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Examine each `img` element in the content.
2. Check that each `img` element which conveys meaning contains an `alt` attribute.
3. If the image contains words that are important to understanding the content, the words are included in the text alternative.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

Checks #2 and #3 are true.

### H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls <a id="h44"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to use the `label` element to explicitly associate a form control with a label. A `label` is attached to a specific form control through the use of the `for` attribute. The value of the `for` attribute must be the same as the value of the `id` attribute of the form control.

         

The `id` attribute may have the same value as the `name` attribute, but both must be provided, and the `id` must be unique in the web page.

         

This technique is sufficient for Success Criteria [1.1.1 (Non-Text Content)](../../Understanding/non-text-content.html), [1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)](../../Understanding/info-and-relationships.html) and [4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value)](../../Understanding/name-role-value.html) whether or not the `label` element is visible. That is, it may be hidden using CSS. However, for Success Criterion [3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions)](../../Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html), the `label` element must be visible since it provides assistance to all users who need help understanding the purpose of the field.

      

An additional benefit of this technique is a larger clickable area for the control, since clicking on either the label or the control will activate the control. This can be helpful for users with impaired motor control.

      

Note that the `label` is positioned after `input` elements of `type="checkbox"` and `type="radio"`.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> Elements that use explicitly associated labels are:
> 
> 
>

>          
> 
> The `label` element is **not** used for the following elements:

> 
>          
> 
> - `button` (the label is provided by the content)
> - `input type="button"`  (the label is provided by the content)
> - `input type="hidden"`
> - `input type="image"` (the label is provided by the `alt` attribute)
> - `input type="reset"` (the label is label provided by the `value` attribute)
> - `input type="submit"` (the label is label provided by the `value` attribute)
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
##### A text input field

         

The text field in this example has the explicit label of "First name:". The `label` element's `for` attribute matches the `id` attribute of the `input` element.

         

```html
<label for="firstname">First name:</label> 
<input id="firstname" name="firstname" type="text">
```

      

      

         

##### A checkbox

```html
<input checked id="markuplang" name="computerskills" type="checkbox">
<label for="markuplang">HTML</label>
```

      

      

         

##### A group of radio buttons

         

A small, related group of radio buttons with a clear description and labels for each individual element.

         

```html
<h1>Doughnut Selection</h1>
<form action="/buy-doughnuts" method="post">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Pick the doughnut you would like</legend>
    <input id="dn-choc" name="flavor" type="radio" value="chocolate">
    <label for="dn-choc">Chocolate</label>
    <input id="dn-cream" name="flavor" type="radio" value="cream">
    <label for="dn-cream">Cream Filled</label>
    <input id="dn-raspberry" name="flavor" type="radio" value="raspberry">
    <label for="dn-raspberry">Raspberry Filled</label>
  </fieldset>
  <input type="submit" value="Purchase Your Doughnut">
</form>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For all `input` elements of type `text`, `file` or `password`, for all `textarea` elements, and for all `select` elements in the web page:

         

1. Check that there is a `label` element that identifies the purpose of the control before the `input`, `textarea`, or `select` element
2. Check that the `for` attribute of the `label` element matches the `id` of the `input`, `textarea`, or `select` element.
3. Check that the `label` element is visible.

         

For all `input` elements of type checkbox or radio in the web page:

         

1. Check that there is a `label` element that identifies the purpose of the control after the `input` element.
2. Check that the `for` attribute of the `label` element matches the `id` of the `input` element.
3. Check that the `label` element is visible.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #2 are true.
- For Success Criterion 3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions), check #3 is also true.

### H49: Using semantic markup to mark emphasized or special text <a id="h49"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how semantic markup can be used to
            mark emphasized or special text so that it can be programmatically determined. Using
            semantic markup to mark emphasized or special text also provides structure to the
            document. User agents can then make the structure perceivable to the user, for example
            using a different visual presentation for different types of structures or by using a
            different voice or pitch in an auditory presentation.

      

Most user agents will visually distinguish text that has been identified using semantic
            markup. Some assistive technologies provide a mechanism for determining the
            characteristics of content that has been created using proper semantic markup.

#### Examples
See [rendered examples of semantic text](../../working-examples/semantic-text/).

      

         

##### Using the em and strong elements
            to emphasize text

         
            

The `em` and `strong` elements are
                designed to indicate structural emphasis that may be rendered in a variety of ways
                (font style changes, speech inflection changes, etc.).

         
         
```html
 ... What she <em>really</em> meant to say was, &quot;This is not OK, 
 it is <strong>excellent</strong>&quot;! ...
```

      

      

         

##### Using the blockquote element to mark up long quotations from another source

         
            

This example also demonstrates the use of the `cite` element to specify a reference.

         
         
```html
<p>The following is an excerpt from the <cite>The Story Of My Life</cite> 
   by Helen Keller:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even in the days before my teacher came, I used to feel along the square stiff
     boxwood hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell, would find the first violets
     and lilies. There, too, after a fit of temper, I went to find comfort and to hide
     my hot face in the cool leaves and grass.</p>
</blockquote>
```

      

      

         

##### Using the q element to mark up a shorter quotation from another source

         
         

Quotation marks aren't manually added to the quote because they are added by the user agent.

         

```html
<p>Helen Keller said, <q>Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, 
   we can never do anything good in the world</q>.</p>
```

      

      

         

##### Using the sup and sub elements to mark up superscripts and subscripts

         
            

The `sup` and `sub` elements must be used only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical presentation for presentation's sake.

         

```html
<p>Henry won 1<sup>st</sup> place in the 9<sup>th</sup> grade science competition.</p>
<p>The chemical notation for water is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
```

      

   	

         

##### Using the code element to mark up code

   		

This example shows use of the `code` element to provide visual emphasis for a CSS rule:

   		
```html
<code>
.trial {
  background-image: url(30daytrial.jpg);
  background-position: left top;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  padding-top: 68px;
} 
</code>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Examine the content for information that is conveyed through variations in presentation of text.
2. Check that appropriate semantic markup (such as `em`, `strong`, `cite`, `blockquote`, `sub`, and `sup`) have been used to mark the text that conveys information through variations in text.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- Check #2 is true.

### H53: Using the body of the object element <a id="h53"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a text alternative for content rendered
            using the object element. The body of the `object` element can be used to provide a complete text alternative for the object, or may contain additional non-text content with text alternatives.

   	

Fallback content for the `object` element is only available to the user when the media loaded by the element is not rendered by the user agent, because the user agent does not support the media technology or the user has instructed the user agent not to render that technology. In these situations, the fallback content will be presented to the user. If the media is rendered without the fallback content, the media needs to be directly accessible. Authors can only rely on this technique to satisfy the success criterion if they are not relying on the direct accessibility of the media's technology in their conformance claim, and reasonably expect users will be able to access the fallback.

#### Examples
##### An object includes a long description that describes it

				
```html
<object classid="https://www.example.com/analogclock.py">
  <p>Here is some text that describes the object and its operation.</p>
</object>
```

      

      

         

##### An object includes non-text content with a text alternative

         
```html
<object classid="https://www.example.com/animatedlogo.py">
  <img src="staticlogo.gif" alt="Company Name">
</object>
```

      

      

         

##### The image object has content that provides a brief description of the function of the image

         
```html
<object data="companylogo.gif" type="image/gif">
  <p>Company Name</p>
</object>
```

      

      

				

This example takes advantage of the fact the `object` elements may be nested to provide for alternative representations of information.

         
         
```html
<object classid="java:Press.class" width="500" height="500">
  <object data="pressure.mpeg" type="video/mpeg">
    <object data="pressure.gif" type="image/gif">
      As temperature increases, the molecules in the balloon...
    </object>
  </object>
</object>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

1. Check that the body of each `object` element contains a text alternative for the object.

      

      

				

##### Expected Results

        

- #1 is true.

### H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element <a id="h57"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to identify the default language of a document by providing the `lang` attribute on the `html` element.

      

Identifying the language of the document is important for a number of reasons:

      

- It allows braille translation software to substitute control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.
- Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to orient and adapt to the pronunciation and syntax that are specific to the language of the page, speaking the text in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation.
- Marking the language can benefit future developments in technology, for example users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use machines to translate unfamiliar languages.
- Marking the language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using a dictionary.

#### Examples
##### Defining the content of an HTML document to be in French

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>document écrit en français</title>
</head>
<body>
  ... document écrit en français ...
</body>
</html>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

Examine the `html` element of the document.

         

1. Check that the `html` element has a `lang` attribute.
2. Check that the value of the `lang` attribute conforms to [BCP 47: Tags for Identifying Languages; Matching of Language Tags](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) or its successor and reflects the primary language used by the web page.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #1 and #2 are true.

### H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language <a id="h58"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to clearly identify any changes in language on a page by using the `lang` attribute.

      

Allowed values for the `lang` attribute are indicated in the resources referenced below. Language tags use a primary code to indicate the language, and optional sub-codes (separated by hyphen characters) to indicate variants of the language. For instance, English is indicated with the primary code `"en"`; British English and American English can be distinguished by using `"en-GB"` and `"en-US"`, respectively. Use of the primary code is important for this technique. Use of sub-codes is optional but may be helpful in certain circumstances.

#### Examples
##### The use of the lang attribute to define a quote written in German

```html
<blockquote lang="de">
  <p>
    Da dachte der Herr daran, ihn aus dem Futter zu schaffen,
    aber der Esel merkte, daß kein guter Wind wehte, lief fort
    und machte sich auf den Weg nach Bremen: dort, meinte er,
    könnte er ja Stadtmusikant werden.
  </p>
</blockquote>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each element in the document:

         

1. Check that the human language of the content of the element is the same as the
                  inherited language for the element as specified in [HTML - The `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes).

         

For each `lang` attribute in the document:

         

1. Check that the value of the `lang` attribute conforms to [BCP 47: Tags for Identifying Languages; Matching of Language Tags](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) or its successor.
2. Check that the language code matches the language of the content it applies to.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- All checks above are true.

### H65: Using the title attribute to identify form controls when the label element cannot be used <a id="h65"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to use the `title` attribute to provide an accessible name for form controls when the visual design does not include text on the screen that can be associated with the control as a label. User agents, including assistive technology, can speak the `title` attribute.

#### Examples
##### A pulldown menu that limits the scope of a search

      

A search form uses a pulldown menu to limit the scope of the search. The pulldown menu is immediately adjacent to the text field used to enter the search term. The relationship between the search field and the pulldown menu is clear to users who can see the visual design, which does not have room for a separate visible label. The `title` attribute is used to identify the `select` menu. The `title` attribute can be spoken by screen readers or displayed as a tool tip for people using screen magnifiers. There must be visual information on the page which allows sighted users to understand the purpose of the form controls and user agents.

   

```html
<label for="search-term">Search for:</label>
<input id="search-term" name="search-term" type="text" value="">
<select title="Search in" id="scope">
  ...
</select>
```

      

      

				

##### Input fields for a phone number

 
				

A web page contains controls for entering a phone number in the United States, with three fields for area code, exchange, and last four digits.

         

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Phone number</legend>
  <input id="area-code" name="area-code" title="Area Code" 
   type="text" size="3" value="">
  <input id="exchange" name="exchange" title="First three digits of phone number" 
   type="text" size="3" value="">
  <input id="last-digits" name="last-digits" title="Last four digits of phone number" 
   type="text" size="4" value="">
</fieldset>
```

      

      

				

##### A Search Function

				

A web page contains a text field where the user can enter search terms and a button labeled "Search" for performing the search. The `title` attribute is used to identify the form control and the button is positioned right after the text field so that it is clear to the user that the text field is where the search term should be entered.

 

```html
<input type="text" title="Type search term here"> <input type="submit" value="Search">

```

      

      

				

##### A data table of form controls

        

A data table of form controls needs to associate each control with the column and row headers for that cell. Without a title (or off-screen label) it is difficult for non-visual users to pause and interrogate for corresponding row or column header values using their assistive technology while tabbing through the form.

				

For example, a survey form has four column headers in first row: Question, Agree, Undecided, Disagree. Each following row contains a question and a radio button in each cell corresponding to answer choice in the three columns. The title attribute for every radio button contains the information necessary to identify the control.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

      

For all form controls that are not associated with a `label` element:

 
			

1. Check that the control has a `title` attribute
2. Check that the purpose of the form control is clear to users who can see the control.
3. Check that the `title` attribute identifies the purpose of the control and that it matches the apparent visual purpose.

      

      

				

##### Expected Results

				

- Checks above are true.

### H67: Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that assistive technology should ignore <a id="h67"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to show how images can be marked so that they can be ignored by assistive technology.

         

If no `title` attribute is used, and the `alt` text is set to null (i.e., `alt=""`) it indicates to assistive technology that the image can be safely ignored.

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> Having a "null" `alt` attribute is not the same as having no `alt` attribute.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
##### Inserting a decorative image on a web page

 

```html
<img alt="" src="squiggle.gif" height="20" width="20">
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each image that should be ignored:

         

1. Check that `title` attribute is either absent or empty.
2. Check that `alt` attribute is present and empty.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- #1 and #2 are true

### H71: Providing a description for groups of form controls using fieldset and legend elements <a id="h71"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a semantic grouping for related form controls. This allows users to understand the relationship of the controls and interact with the form more quickly and effectively.

         

Form controls can be grouped by enclosing them within the `fieldset` element. All controls within a given `fieldset` are then related. The first element inside the `fieldset` must be a `legend` element, which provides a label or description for the group. Authors should avoid nesting `fieldset`s unnecessarily, as this can lead to confusion.

         

Grouping controls is most important for related radio buttons and checkboxes. A set of radio buttons or checkboxes is related when they all submit values for a single named field. They work in the same way as selection lists, allowing the user to choose from a set of options, except selection lists are single controls while radio buttons and checkboxes are multiple controls. The individual label associated with each radio or checkbox control may not fully convey the group's descriptive context. In this situation, it is essential that they be grouped together semantically to facilitate being treated as a single control, as well as to provide an additional group level description. Often, user agents will present the value of the `legend` before the label of each control to provide this description, as well as to remind users that they are part of the same group.

         

It can also be useful to group other sets of controls less tightly related than radio buttons and checkboxes. For instance, several fields that collect a user's address might be grouped together with a `legend` of "Address", thus providing a group level description for these controls. As a rule of thumb, it can be said that where a group of controls within a larger form requires an additional heading to provide a description specific to that particular group, the use of fieldset and legend elements is appropriate.

         

However, when a group of related radio buttons or checkboxes (even having values for a single named field) includes clear instructions and distinct selections (i.e., where the individual label associated with each particular control provides a sufficient description), the use of the `fieldset` and `legend` elements is not required. [H44](../html/H44) is sufficient in this case.

         

Authors sometimes avoid using the `fieldset` element because of the default display in the browser, which draws a border around the grouped controls. This visual grouping is also useful and authors should seriously consider retaining it (or some form of visual grouping). The visual effect can be modified in CSS by overriding the `border` property of the `fieldset` and the `position` property of the `legend`.

#### Examples
##### A multiple choice test

   
            

This example shows a test item with one question and five possible answers. Each answer is represented by a radio button (`input type="radio"`). The radio buttons are contained within a `fieldset`. The test question is tagged with the `legend` element. Each field has the same `name` attribute, indicating these radio buttons are related, and should be grouped as shown. Also note that while the `name` attributes have the same value, the `id` attributes' values must be unique.

         

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>The play <cite>Hamlet</cite> was written by:</legend>
  <div>
    <input checked="checked" id="shakesp" name="hamlet" type="radio" value="a">
    <label for="shakesp">William Shakespeare</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input id="austen" name="hamlet" type="radio" value="b">
    <label for="austen">Jane Austen</label>
  </div>
  <div>    
    <input id="gbshaw" name="hamlet" type="radio" value="c">
    <label for="gbshaw">George Bernard Shaw</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input id="woolf" name="hamlet" type="radio" value="d">
    <label for="woolf">Virginia Woolf</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input id="dickens" name="hamlet" type="radio" value="e">
    <label for="dickens">Charles Dickens</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

      

      

         

##### A set of checkboxes

         

The User Profile page for a website allows users to indicate their interests by selecting multiple checkboxes. Each checkbox (`input type="checkbox"`) has a `label`. The checkboxes are contained within a `fieldset`, and the `legend` element contains the prompt for the entire group of checkboxes.

         

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>I am interested in the following (check all that apply):</legend>
  <div>
    <input id="photo" name="interests" type="checkbox" value="ph">
    <label for="photo">Photography</label>
  </div>
  <div>    
    <input checked="checked" id="watercol" name="interests" type="checkbox" value="wa">
    <label for="watercol">Watercolor</label>
  </div>
  <div>  
    <input checked="checked" id="acrylic" name="interests" type="checkbox" value="ac">
    <label for="acrylic">Acrylic</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

      

      

         

##### Logically related controls

         

In this example, form fields for residential and postal addresses are distinguished by the value of the `legend` in each `fieldset` grouping.

         

```html
<form action="/adduser" method="post">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Your Residential Address</legend>
    <div>
      <label for="raddress">Address:</label>
      <input autocomplete="street-address" id="raddress" name="raddress" type="text">
    </div>
    <div>
      <label for="rzip">Postal/Zip Code:</label>
      <input autocomplete="postal-code" id="rzip" name="rzip" type="text">
    </div>    
  </fieldset>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Your Postal Address</legend>
    <div>    
      <label for="paddress">Address:</label>
      <input autocomplete="street-address" id="paddress" name="paddress" type="text">
    </div>
    <div>      
      <label for="pzip">Postal/Zip Code:</label>
      <input autocomplete="postal-code" id="pzip" name="pzip" type="text">
    </div>    
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For groups of related controls where the individual labels for each control do not provide a sufficient description, and an additional group level description is needed:

         

1. Check that the group of logically related `input` or `select` elements are contained within `fieldset` elements.
2. Check that each `fieldset` has a `legend` element that is the first child in the `fieldset` and includes a description for that group.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- All of the checks are true.

### H86: Providing text alternatives for emojis, emoticons, ASCII art, and leetspeak <a id="h86"></a>

#### Description
Emojis are very popular and are frequently used online to help provide more context and expression to text-based communication. Emojis come with their own pre-defined names that might not always match what the author is intending to communicate. For example, the emoji of a black right-facing triangle (►) is described by default as *black right-pointing pointer*, which would be confusing if a designer had changed its rotation or color, or if it was being used to give the accessible name to a "play" button in a multimedia player.

         

Emoticons pre-date emojis, are still used but are much less popular than they once were. Emoticons use ASCII characters to create facial expressions and other ways to communicate an emotion. Because emoticons are made from many text characters, they can be confusing for screen reader users. When possible it is better simply to use a word like "smile" or a suitable emoji instead of an emoticon. If emoticons are used they should have a text alternative.

         

ASCII art was common on the internet before graphics became widely used. ASCII characters were arranged to form pictures, pictures of text, or graphs. Although ASCII content is not used frequently on the web anymore, it must be remembered that, when it is used, it can be very confusing to people who are accessing the internet using screen readers. If ASCII art is used, it should also have a text explanation of what the picture is. It is also suggested that, if the ASCII picture isn't marked up as an image using ARIA, that there is a link to skip over the art (although this is not required).

         

Leet used to be a fairly-common part of Internet culture and slang, but is now hardly used. Leetspeak uses various combinations of characters, including numerals and special characters, to replace standard characters. Leet is often incomprehensible to people using screen readers, and therefore requires a text alternative in order to conform to [Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-Text Content)](../../Understanding/non-text-content.html).

#### Examples
##### Marking up emojis in a sentence

            

This shows a technique to mark up emojis with accessible names that differ from their default. Because you can't use an `alt` attribute on a `span` element and the ARIA recommendation disallows accessible names on generic elements, to give the emojis accessible names they are defined as images with the ARIA `role="img"` property which then allows the creation of an accessible name using the `aria-label` property.

```html
<p>I smiled at my friend and gestured 
   <span aria-label="you" role="img">👉🏾</span>
   <span aria-label="rock" role="img">🤘🏾</span>!
</p>
```

         

         

            

##### Four options for providing alternatives for an emoticon representing "smile"

            

The following shows four options for providing alternatives for an emoticon representing "smile", which is consists of a colon followed by a closing parenthesis.

```html
<abbr title="smile">:)</abbr>
<span aria-label="smile" role="img">:)</span>
<img alt="smile" src="smile.gif">
```

         

            

##### Using the aria-label and role="img" properties

            

Adding the `role="img"` property to the ASCII content's containing element defines it as an image, and the `aria-label` property gives it the required text alternative. [Skip to the next ASCII example](#ascii-butterfly).

```html

<div aria-label="WCAG" role="img">
oooooo   oooooo     oooo   .oooooo.         .o.         .oooooo.    
 `888.    `888.     .8'   d8P'  `Y8b       .888.       d8P'  `Y8b   
   `888.   .8888.   .8'   888              .8"888.     888           
    `888  .8'`888. .8'    888             .8' `888.    888           
     `888.8'  `888.8'     888            .88ooo8888.   888     ooooo 
       `888'    `888'      `88b    ooo   .8'     `888.  `88.    .88'  
        `8'      `8'        `Y8bood8P'  o88o     o8888o  `Y8bood8P'
</div>
```

         

      

         

##### ASCII art with an explanation of the picture preceding it

         

This example includes a link to skip over the ASCII art. [Skip to the Leetspeak example](#leetspeak).

The following is Leetspeak for "Austin Rocks".

```html
<abbr title="Austin Rocks">Au5t1N r0xx0rz</abbr>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Check to see that the content contains emojis, emoticons, ASCII art, or leetspeak.
2. Check that each emoji has a text alternative that serves an equivalent purpose.
3. Check that each ASCII artwork, emoticon, and / or Leetspeak either:
               

1. is marked up as an image with a text alternative that serves an equivalent purpose; or
2. has a text alternative immediately before or after.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- Checks #2 and #3 are true.

### H98: Using HTML autocomplete attributes <a id="h98"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to programmatically link a pre-defined and published taxonomic term to the input, so that the inputs can also be machine-interpreted. This way the input will always have a common, referable and identifiable value associated to it, no matter what language is used, or what visible on-screen term is used to label the input. Then it can be further customized or otherwise machine-manipulated to help users.

			

The technique works by adding the appropriate `autocomplete` token to each form field on the form to make the identified inputs Programmatically Determinable. This will help people with cognitive disabilities who may not immediately know the purpose of the field because the label used by the author is not familiar to them. When inputs have been programmatically assigned, third party plugins and software can manipulate these form fields to make them more accessible to people with cognitive disabilities. For instance, a plugin could detect an `autocomplete` token with the text string "`tel`" and insert a telephone icon. It will further enable third party software to swap out the existing labels for text labels that the user finds more familiar. For instance, it could change "Given Name" to "First Name".

      

The `autocomplete` attribute also improves the browser's ability to pre-populate form fields with user-preferred values. When the input has been properly "tagged" with the known token value, the value entered by the user is stored locally on the host machine and associated with the token value for reuse. It helps those with dexterity disabilities who have trouble typing, those who may need more time, and anyone who wishes to reduce effort to fill out a form.

        
   		

The `autocomplete` attribute allows the browser to do a pattern match against a list of values locally stored with the browser, and supplies the appropriate corresponding value when the input is programmatically tagged. This is a user setting that can be turned on or off, or modified by the end user. This reduces typing and reliance on memory because it uses stored values to fill in the fields.

      
			

It's important to note the Success Criterion [Identify Input Purpose](../../Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) and `autocomplete` attribute only place requirements on input fields collecting information **about the user**.

	  

For the Success Criterion, it is assumed that the `autocomplete` attribute is not used on form fields that do not correspond to an autocomplete field described in the [HTML `autocomplete` attribute specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofilling-form-controls:-the-autocomplete-attribute). If the `autocomplete` field is used to describe a "custom" taxonomy, rather than that described in the specification, this rule may produce incorrect results.

			

				

##### Security considerations

				

Organizations can be concerned about allowing input fields to be automatically filled-in. There is sometimes confusion about how browsers save information and the security implications.

				

For the `autocomplete` attribute:

				

- This technique should only be used when asking for **data about the user** who is filling the form in, not for other people.
- It only works if you are on the same computer, using the same user-account, and using the same browser. Any multi-login scenario does not save `autocomplete` data between different accounts. (Users can setup syncing of data across computers, but that is not the default.)
- Saving information with `autocomplete` is opt-in by the user, usually at the point of saving data the first time.
- The form is not auto-submitted, the user can see the data before it is submitted.
- It is easy to wipe both history and form data in the browser settings.
- It is easy to engage a privacy mode, such as private browsing.
- Even *without* `autocomplete` set in the web page, browsers can save data, and some plugins (such as password managers) will aggressively use heuristics to guess what fields are for and fill them in. Using the `autocomplete` attribute makes those guesses accurate.

				

The browser history provides far more detail about what people have done, and is just as available as `autocomplete` data. The solutions/mitigations for browser-history are similar to `autocomplete`.

#### Examples
##### A user's credit card information

				

This is a simple form that collects contact and credit card information from the user.

				
```html
<form method="post" action="step2">
  <div>
    <label for="fname">First Name</label>
    <input autocomplete="given-name" id="fname" type="text">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="lname">Last Name</label>
    <input autocomplete="family-name" id="lname" type="text">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="cc-num">Credit card number:</label>
    <input autocomplete="cc-number" id="cc-num" type="text">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="exp-date">Expiry Date:</label>
    <input autocomplete="cc-exp" id="exp-date" type="month">
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Continue">
  </div>
</form>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

For each form field that collects information about the user and corresponds to an `autocomplete` field described in [WCAG 2.1 7. Section 7: Input Purposes for User Interface Components](/TR/WCAG/#input-purposes), check the following:

        

1. The form field has a valid and well-formed `autocomplete` attribute and value pair.
2. The purpose of the form field indicated by the label corresponds with the `autocomplete` token on the input.

			

			

				

##### Expected Results

				

- If #1 and #2 are true, then the test passes and the technique has been successfully implemented.

### H100: Providing properly marked up email and password inputs <a id="h100"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide examples of properly marked up email and password inputs. This technique involves providing form mechanism where the user can enter their email address and password to log into the website.

      

Browsers and password managers generally use the accessible name of the input to determine how to fill it in. The user agent (including password managers) should not be blocked from populating the fields, and pasting by the user should also not be blocked.

#### Examples
##### properly marked up email and password inputs

        

A secure website has an email and password based login form.

        
```html
<form method="post" action="login">
  <div>
    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input autocomplete="email" id="email" type="email" ...>
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input autocomplete="current-password" id="password" type="password" ...>
  </div>
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
  </div>
</form>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

        

For websites which require users to login with an email and password only:

        

1. Check that each input for authentication includes an appropriate accessible-name.
2. Check that each input for authentication allows pasting.

      

      

        

##### Expected Results

        

- #1 and #2 are true.

### H101: Using semantic HTML elements to identify regions of a page <a id="h101"></a>

#### Description
The purpose of this technique is to provide programmatic access to sections of a web page. Landmark roles (or "landmarks") programmatically identify sections of a page. Browsers don't expose landmarks directly to users, but they they are made available to them by assistive technology and browser extensions to help navigation to various sections of a page.

      

Landmarks provide an easy way for users of assistive technology understand the programmatic structure of a page and skip over content they're not interested in. For instance, if a site's header, global navigation, main content area, and footer are marked up as landmarks, a screen reader user can easily skip to the landmark they're interested in without having to work their way through all the preceding content. A blind user who may be familiar with a news site's menu, and is only interested in getting to the top story, could easily navigate to the "main" landmark, and bypass dozens of menu links. In another circumstance, a user who is blind may want to quickly find a navigation menu, and can do so by jumping to the navigation landmark.

      

Landmark regions are implicitly created when certain semantic HTML elements are used, which is different from [using ARIA to explicitly create landmarks](../aria/ARIA11). These elements are:

      

- `<header>`: When a `header` is a direct child of the `body` element, it creates a `banner` role, a region that typically contains the site's logo, name, and other persistent site-wide content at the top of a page.
- `<nav>`: A region that contains navigation links to other pages or different parts of the same page.
- `<main>`: A region that contains a page's main content.
- `<section>`: A region that contains a generic section of a document or application. A `section` element isn't exposed as a landmark region unless it has an accessible name.
- `<form>`: A region of the document that represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing. A `form` element isn't exposed as a landmark region unless it has an accessible name.
- `<aside>`: A region of the document that supports the main content, yet is separate and meaningful on its own.
- `<footer>`: A region that, when its nearest ancestor is the `body` element, contains information about the page such as copyrights and links to privacy statements.

      

Modern web browsers don't need to have the HTML element's related ARIA role added to them to be exposed as a landmark region. For example, `<main role="main">` is unnecessary, and should just be `<main>`.

      

There are cases when a particular landmark role can be used more than once on a page, for example, primary and secondary blocks of navigation. In these cases, identical roles should be labeled using a valid technique for labelling regions.

      

It is a best practice to include all content on the page in landmarks, so that screen reader users who rely on landmarks to navigate from section to section do not lose track of content.

#### Examples
##### Simple landmarks

      

The following example shows how landmarks might be added to an HTML document:

```html
<header> site logo and name, etc. here </header>
<form aria-label="site search"> search functionality here </form>
<nav> a list of navigation links here </nav>
<main> the page's main content here </main>
<section> a sponsor's promotion here </section>
<aside> sidebar content here </aside>
<footer> site contact details, copyright information, etc. here </footer>
```

  

  

    

##### Multiple landmarks of the same type and aria-labelledby

    

The following example shows a best practice of how landmarks might be added to an HTML document in situations where there are two or more of the same type of landmark on the same page. For instance, if a `nav` element is used multiple times on a page, each instance may have a unique label specified using `aria-labelledby`:

```html
<nav aria-labelledby="site-nav-heading">
  <h2 id="site-nav-heading">Site</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/news">News</a></li>  
    <li><a href="/weather">Weather</a></li>
    <li><a href="/sport">Sport</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<nav aria-labelledby="related-nav-heading">
  <h2 id="related-nav-heading">Related Topics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/local-news">Local News</a></li>
    <li><a href="/local-weather">Local Weather</a></li>
    <li><a href="/local-sport">Local Sport</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

  

  

    

##### Multiple landmarks of the same type and aria-label

    

The following example shows a best practice of how landmarks might be added to an HTML document in situations where there are two or more of the same type of landmark on the same page, and there is no existing text on the page that can be referenced as the label:

```html
<nav aria-label="Vehicles">
  <ul>
    <li><a aria-current="page" href="/cars">Cars</a></li>
    <li><a href="/trucks">Trucks</a></li>
    <li><a href="/bikes">Bikes</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<nav aria-label="Tags">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/cars-electric">Electric Cars</a></li>
    <li><a href="/cars-gas">Gas-powered Cars</a></li>
    <li><a href="/cars-family">Family Cars</a></li>
    <li><a href="/cars-working">Rugged Cars For Working</a></li>
    <li><a href="/cars-commuting">Cars For Suburban Commuting</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

  

  

    

##### Search form

    

The following example shows a search form. A `form` element must have an accessible name to be exposed as a landmark area:

```html
<form aria-labelledby="search-label">
  <label for="product-search" id="search-label">Search</label>
  <input id="product-search" placeholder="title, author, or ISBN" type="text">
  <button type="submit">Find Books</button>
</form>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

    

1. Examine each HTML element that creates a [landmark role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#landmark_roles).
2. Examine whether the correct element has been used to mark up content. For example: a `nav` element has been used to mark up a section with navigation links, or the `main` element is used to contain the page's main content.
3. If a landmark region needs to have an accessible name to be exposed as a landmark, check to see that there is an accessible name.

  

  

    

##### Expected Results

    

- Checks #1, #2, and #3 are true.

### SCR1: Allowing the user to extend the default time limit <a id="scr1"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to allow user to extend the default time limit by providing a mechanism to extend the time when scripts provide functionality that has default time limits. In order to allow the user to request a longer time limit, the script can provide a form allowing the user to enter a larger time limit or indicating that more time is needed. If the user is being warned that a time limit is about to expire (see [providing a script that warns the user a time limit is about to expire](SCR16)), this form can be made available from the warning dialog. The user can extend the time limit to at least 10 times the default time limit, either by allowing the user to indicate how much additional time is needed or by repeatedly allowing the user to extend the time limit.

#### Examples
- A web page contains current stock market statistics and is set to refresh periodically. When the user is warned prior to refreshing the first time, the user is provided with an option to extend the time period between refreshes.
- In an online chess game, each player is given a time limit for completing each move. When the player is warned that time is almost up for this move, the user is provided with an option to increase the time.

#### Tests
##### Procedure

			

1. On a web page that uses scripts to enforce a time limit, wait until the time limit has expired.
2. Determine if an option was provided to extend the time limit.

		

		

			

##### Expected Results

			

- 2 is true and more time is provided to complete the interaction.

### SCR16: Providing a script that warns the user a time limit is about to expire <a id="scr16"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to notify users that they are almost out of time to complete an interaction. When scripts provide functionality that has time limits, the script can include functionality to warn the user of imminent time limits and provide a mechanism to request more time. 20 seconds or more before the time limit occurs, the script provides a confirm dialog that states that a time limit is imminent and asks if the user needs more time. If the user answers "yes" then the time limit is reset. If the user answers "no" or does not respond, the time limit is allowed to expire.

      

This technique involves time limits set with the `window.setTimeout()` method. If, for example, the time limit is set to expire in 60 seconds, you can set the time limit for 40 seconds and provide the confirm dialog. When the confirm dialog appears, a new time limit is set for the remaining 20 seconds. Upon expiry of the "grace period time limit" the action that would have been taken at the expiry of the 60 second time limit in the original design is taken.

#### Examples
A page of stock market quotes uses script to refresh the page every five minutes in order to ensure the latest statistics remain available. 20 seconds before the five minute period expires, a confirm dialog appears asking if the user needs more time before the page refreshes. This allows the user to be aware of the impending refresh and to avoid it if desired.

         

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <title>Stock Market Quotes</title>
   <script>
     function timeControl() {
     // set timer for 4 min 40 sec, then ask user to confirm.
     setTimeout('userCheck()', 280000);
     }

     function userCheck() {
     // set page refresh for 20 sec
     var id=setTimeout('pageReload()', 20000);
     // If user selects "OK" the timer is reset 
     // else the page will refresh from the server.
     if (confirm("This page is set to refresh in 20 seconds. 
       Would you like more time?"))
       {
          clearTimeout(id);
          timeControl();
       }
     }

     function pageReload() {
       window.location.reload(true);
     }

    timeControl();
  </script>
</head>
<body>
   <h1>Stock Market Quotes</h1>
   ...
</body>
</html>
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

On a web page that has a time limit controlled by a script:

         

1. Load the page and start a timer that is 20 seconds less than the time limit.
2. When the timer expires, check that a confirmation dialog is displayed warning of the impending time limit.

      

      

         

##### Expected Results

         

- #2 is true.

### SCR18: Providing client-side validation and alert <a id="scr18"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to validate user input as values are entered for each field, by means of client-side scripting. If errors are found, an alert dialog describes the nature of the error in text. Once the user dismisses the alert dialog, it is helpful if the script positions the keyboard focus on the field where the error occurred.

#### Examples
##### Checking a single control with an event handler

         
            

The following script will check that a valid date has been entered in the form control.

         

```html
<label for="date">Date:</label>
<input type="text" name="date" id="date" 
  onchange="if(isNaN(Date.parse(this.value))) 
  alert('This control is not a valid date. 
  Please re-enter the value.');">
```

      

   	

   		

##### Checking multiple controls when the user submits the form

   		
   			

The following sample shows multiple controls in a form. The `form` element uses the `onsubmit` attribute which creates an event handler to execute the validation script when the user attempts to submit the form. If the validation is successful, the event returns `true` and the form submission proceeds; if the validation finds errors, it displays an error message and returns `false` to cancel the submit attempt so the user can fix the problems.

   			

> **Note:**
> >    				
> 
> This example demonstrates an alert for simplicity. A more helpful notification to the user would be to highlight the controls with problems and add information to the page about the nature of the errors and how to navigate to the controls that require data fixes.
> 
> 
>    				
> 
> Although this example uses an `onsubmit` attribute on the `form` element for brevity, normal practice is to create a submit event listener when the page is loaded.
>

Script code:

```javascript
function validate() {
  // initialize error message
  var msg = "";
	
  //validate name
  var pattern = /^[a-zA-Z\s]+$/;
  var el = document.getElementById("name");
  
  if (!pattern.test(el.value)) {
    msg += "Name can only have letters and spaces. ";
  }
	
  // validate number
  var pattern = /^[\d\-+\.\s]+$/;
  var el = document.getElementById("tel");

  if (!pattern.test(el.value)) {
    msg += "Telephone number can only have digits and separators. ";
  }
	
  if (msg != "") {
    alert(msg);
    return false;
  }
  else {
  return true;
  }
```

   			

Form code:

```html
<form action="multiple-controls.html" onsubmit="return validate()">
  <div>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input autocomplete="name" id="name" name="name" type="text">
  </div>
  <div>

### SCR19: Using an onchange event on a select element without causing a change of
                    context <a id="scr19"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to correctly use an onchange event with a select element to update other elements on the web page. This technique will not cause a change of context. When there are one or more select elements on the web page, an onchange event on one, can update the options in another select element on the web page. All of the data required by the select elements is included within the web page.

      

It is important to note that the select item which is modified is after the trigger select element in the reading order of the web page. This ensures that assistive technologies will pick up the change and users will encounter the new data when the modified element receives focus. This technique relies on JavaScript support in the user agent.

#### Examples
This example contains two select elements. When an item is selected in the first select, the choices in the other select are updated appropriately. The first select element contains a list of continents. The second select element will contain a partial list of countries located in the selected continent. There is an onchange event associated with the continent select. When the continent selection changes, the items in the country select are modified using JavaScript via the Document Object Model (DOM). All of the data required, the list of countries and continents, is included within the web page.

            

Overview of the code below

            

- `countryLists` array variable which contains the list of countries for each continent in the trigger select element.
- `countryChange()` function which is called by the onchange event of the continent select element.
- The HTML code to create the select elements in the body of the web page.

         

```html
<!doctype html> 
<html lang="en"> 
  <head> 
    <meta charset=utf-8"> 
    <title>Dynamic Select Statements</title> 
    <script>
    // array of possible countries in the same order as they appear
    // in the country selection list 
    var countryLists = new Array(4) 
    countryLists["empty"] = ["Select a Country"]; 
    countryLists["North America"] = ["Canada", "United States", "Mexico"]; 
    countryLists["South America"] = ["Brazil", "Argentina", "Chile", "Ecuador"]; 
    countryLists["Asia"] = ["Russia", "China", "Japan"]; 
    countryLists["Europe"]= ["Britain", "France", "Spain", "Germany"]; 
  
    /* CountryChange() is called from the onchange event of a select element. 
     * param selectObj - the select object which fired the on change event. 
    */ 
  
    function countryChange(selectObj) { 
    // get the index of the selected option 
    var idx = selectObj.selectedIndex; 
  
    // get the value of the selected option 
    var which = selectObj.options[idx].value; 
  
    // use the selected option value to retrieve the list of items 
    // from the countryLists array 
    cList = countryLists[which]; 
  
    // get the country select element via its known id 
    var cSelect = document.getElementById("country"); 
  
    // remove the current options from the country select 
    var len=cSelect.options.length; 
  
    while (cSelect.options.length > 0) { 
      cSelect.remove(0); 
    } 
  
    var newOption; 
    // create new options 
    for (var i=0; i<cList.length; i++) { 
      newOption = document.createElement("option"); 
      newOption.value = cList[i];  // assumes option string and value are the same 
      newOption.text=cList[i]; 
  
   // add the new option 
    try { 
      cSelect.add(newOption);  // this will fail in DOM browsers but is needed for IE 
    } 
    catch (e) { 
      cSelect.appendChild(newOption); 
    } 
  } 
} 
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Dynamic Select Statements</h1>
  <label for="continent">Select Continent</label>
  <select id="continent" onchange="countryChange(this);">
    <option value="empty">Select a Continent</option>
    <option value="North America">North America</option>
    <option value="South America">South America</option>
    <option value="Asia">Asia</option>
    <option value="Europe">Europe</option>
  </select>
  <div>
    <label for="country">Select a country</label>
    <select id="country">
      <option value="0">Select a country</option>
    </select>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

         
            

Here is a working example: [Dynamic Select](../../working-examples/script-dynamic-select/)

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

1. Navigate to the trigger select element (in this example, the one to select continents) and change the value of the select.
2. Navigate to the select element that is updated by the trigger (in this example, the one to select countries).
3. Check that the matching option values are displayed in the other select element.
4. Navigate to the trigger select element, navigate through the options but do not change the value.
5. Check that the matching option values are still displayed in the associated element.

         

It is recommended that the select elements are tested with an assistive technology to verify that the changes to the associated element are recognized.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- Step #3 and #5 are true.

### SCR22: Using scripts to control blinking and stop it in five seconds or less <a id="scr22"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to control blinking with script so it can be set to stop in less than five seconds by the script. Script is used to start the blinking effect of content, control the toggle between visible and hidden states, and also stop the effect at five seconds or less. The setTimeout() function can be used to toggle blinking content between visible and hidden states, and stop when the number of iterations by the time between them adds up to nearly five seconds.

#### Examples
This example uses JavaScript to control blinking of some HTML and XHTML content. JavaScript creates the blinking effect by changing the visibility status of the content. It controls the start of the effect and stops it within five seconds.

         

```html
...
<div id="blink1" class="highlight">New item!</div>
<script>
  // blink "on" state
  function show() {
   if (document.getElementById){
    document.getElementById("blink1").style.visibility = "visible";
  }
}
   
// blink "off" state
function hide() {
  if (document.getElementById){
    document.getElementById("blink1").style.visibility = "hidden";
  }
}

// toggle "on" and "off" states every 450 ms to achieve a blink effect
// end after 4500 ms (less than five seconds)
for(let i=900; i < 4500; i=i+900) {
  setTimeout("hide()",i);
  setTimeout("show()",i+450);
}
</script>
...
```

         
            

Working example of this code: [Using script to control blinking](../../working-examples/script-control-blink/).

#### Tests
##### Procedure

         

For each instance of blinking content:

         

1. Start a timer for 5 seconds at the start of the blink effect.
2. When the timer expires, determine if the blinking has stopped.

      

      

##### Expected Results

         

- For each instance of blinking content, #2 is true.

### SCR31: Using script to change the background color or border of the element with focus <a id="scr31"></a>

#### Description
This purpose of this technique is to allow the author to use JavaScript to apply CSS, in order to make the focus indicator more visible than it would ordinarily be. When an element receives focus, the background color or border is changed to make it visually distinct. When the element loses focus, it returns to its normal styling. This technique can be used on any HTML user agent that supports Script and CSS, regardless of whether it supports the :focus pseudo class.

#### Examples
In this example, when the link receives focus, its background turns yellow. When it loses focus, the yellow is removed. Note that if the link had a background color to begin with, you would use that color rather than "" in the script.

```html
<script>function toggleFocus(el) {
  el.style.backgroundColor =  el.style.backgroundColor=="yellow" ? "inherit" : "yellow";
}
</script>
...
<a href="example.html" 
 onfocus="toggleFocus(this)" onblur="toggleFocus(this)">focus me</a>
...
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

1. Tab to each element in the page
2. Check that the focus indicator is visible

      

			

##### Expected Results

				

- Step #2 is true

#### Related Techniques

### SCR32: Providing client-side validation and adding error text via the DOM <a id="scr32"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to demonstrate the display of an error message when client side validation of a form field has failed. Anchor elements are used to display the error messages in a list and are inserted above the fields to be validated. Anchor elements are used in the error messages so that focus can be placed on the error message(s), drawing the user's attention to it. The `href` of the anchor elements contain an in-page link which references the fields where error(s) have been found.

      

In a deployed application, if Javascript is turned off, client side validation will not occur. Therefore, this technique would only be sufficient in situations where scripting is relied upon for conformance or when server side validation techniques are also used to catch any errors and return the page with information about the fields with errors.

#### Examples
##### Listing errors in a block at the top of a form

			

This example validates required fields as well as fields where a specific format is required. When an error is identified, the script inserts a list of error messages into the DOM and moves focus to them.

			
				
				Error messages appear as a list of links near the top of the form.
      	
        

				

###### HTML for the form

```html

### SCR33: Using script to scroll content, and providing a mechanism to pause it <a id="scr33"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to provide a way for users to stop scrolling content when the scrolling is created by a script. Scrolling content can be difficult or impossible to read by users with low vision or with cognitive disabilities. The movement can also be distracting for some people making it difficult for them to concentrate on other parts of the web page.

#### Examples
In this example CSS and JavaScript are used to visually present some text in a scrolling format. A link is included to pause the scrolling movement.

            

This implementation will display the full text and omit the link when JavaScript or CSS are unsupported or inactive.

            

##### The HTML component

```html
...
<div id="scroller">
  <p id="tag">This text will scroll and a Pause/Scroll link will be present 
  when JavaScript and CSS are supported and active.</p>
</div>
...
```

         

##### The CSS component

```css
...
body {
  font:1em verdana,sans-serif;
  color:#000;
  margin:0
}

#scroller {
  position:relative;
  overflow:hidden;
  width:15em;
  border:1px solid #008080;
}
  
#tag {
  margin:2px 0;
}

#testP {
  visibility:hidden;
  position:absolute;
  white-space:nowrap;
} 

 #top {
  width:350px;
  margin:auto;
}
...
```

         

##### The JavaScript component

         

```javascript
var speed=50        // speed of scroller

### SCR34: Calculating size and position in a way that scales with text size <a id="scr34"></a>

#### Description
The objective of this technique is to calculate the size and position of elements in a way that will scale appropriately as the text size is scaled.

      

There are four properties in JavaScript that help determine the size and position of elements:

      

- `offsetHeight` (the height of the element in pixels)
- `offsetWidth` (the width of the element in pixels)
- `offsetLeft` (the distance of the element from the left of its parent (`offsetParent`) in pixels)
- `offsetTop` (the distance of the element from the top of its parent (`offsetParent`) in pixels)

      

Calculating the height and width using `offsetHeight` and `offsetWidth` is straightforward, but when calculating an object's left and top position as absolute values, we need to consider the parent element. The `calculatePosition` function below iterates through all of an element's parent nodes to give a final value. The function takes two parameters: `objElement` (the name of the element in question), and the offset property (`offsetLeft` or `offsetTop`):

#### Examples
##### Calculating the size and position of elements in a way that will scale appropriately as the text size is scaled

  

```javascript
function calculatePosition(objElement, strOffset {
  var iOffset = 0;
	if (objElement.offsetParent) {
    do {
      iOffset += objElement[strOffset];
      objElement = objElement.offsetParent;
    } while (objElement);
  }
  return iOffset;
}
```

         
            

The following example illustrates using the function above by aligning an object beneath a reference object, the same distance from the left:

         

```javascript
// Get a reference object
var objReference = document.getElementById('refobject');
// Get the object to be aligned
var objAlign = document.getElementById('lineup');

objAlign.style.position = 'absolute';
objAlign.style.left = calculatePosition(objReference, 'offsetLeft') + 'px';
objAlign.style.top = calculatePosition(objReference, 'offsetTop')
 + objReference.offsetHeight + 'px'; 
```

#### Tests
##### Procedure

				

1. Open a page that is designed to adjust container sizes as text size changes.
2. Increase the text size up to 200% using the browser's text size adjustment (not the zoom feature).
3. Examine the text to ensure the text container size is adjusted to accommodate the size of the text.
4. Ensure that no text is "clipped" or has disappeared as a result of the increase in text size.

### SCR36: Providing a mechanism to allow users to display moving, scrolling, or auto-updating text in a static window or area <a id="scr36"></a>

#### Description
Some web pages display scrolling text because there is limited space available. Scrolling the text in a small text window makes the content available for users who can read quickly enough, but causes problems for users who read more slowly or use assistive technology. This technique provides a mechanism to stop the movement and make the entire block of text available statically. The text may be made available in a separate window or in a (larger) section of the page. Users can then read the text at their own speed.

      

This technique does not apply when the text that is moving can not be displayed all at once on the screen (e.g., a long chat conversation).

      

> **Note:**
> >          
> 
> This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a [conforming alternate version]() for non-conforming content. Refer to [C29: Using a style switcher to provide a conforming alternate version](../css/C29) and [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](../../Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions) for more information.
> 
> 
>

#### Examples
##### Expanding Scrolling Text in Place

         
            

A large block of text is scrolled through a small marquee area of the page. A button lets the user stop the scrolling and display the entire block of text.

            

> **Note:**
> >                
> 
> This code example requires that both CSS and JavaScript be turned on and available.

###### The CSS component

         

```css
#scrollContainer {
  background-color: darkblue;
  left: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
  top: 50px;
  visibility: visible;
}

.scrolling {
  height: 50px;
  position: absolute;
  width: 200px;
}

.notscrolling {
  margin:10px;
  width: 500px;
}

#scrollingText {
  color: white;
  top: 0px;
}

.scrolling #scrollingText {
  position: absolute;
}
```

         

###### The script and HTML content:

```html
<script>
var tid;
function init() {
  var st = document.getElementById('scrollingText');
  st.style.top = '0px';
  initScrolling();
}

function initScrolling () {
  tid = setInterval('scrollText()', 300);
}
	
function scrollText () {
  var st = document.getElementById('scrollingText');
  if (parseInt(st.style.top) > (st.offsetHeight*(-1) + 8)) {
    st.style.top = (parseInt(st.style.top) - 5) + 'px';
  }
  else {
    var sc = document.getElementById('scrollContainer');
    st.style.top = parseInt(sc.offsetHeight) + 8 + 'px';
  }
}

function toggle() {
  var scr = document.getElementById('scrollContainer');
  if (scr.className == 'scrolling') {
    scr.className = 'notscrolling';
    clearInterval(tid);
    document.getElementById('scrollButton').value="Shrink";
  }
  else {
    scr.className = 'scrolling';
    initScrolling();
    document.getElementById('scrollButton').value="Expand";
  }
}

<input type="button" id="scrollButton" value="Expand" onclick="toggle()">
<div id="scrollContainer" class="scrolling">
  <div id="scrollingText" class="on">
    ... Text to be scrolled ...
  </div>
</div>
...
```

### SCR39: Making content on focus or hover hoverable, dismissible, and persistent <a id="scr39"></a>

#### Description
Additional content that is displayed when a user moves the pointer over a trigger or moves the keyboard focus to the trigger (for example, a pop-up) must remain visible to allow users time to read and interact with the content and must allow the user to move the pointer over the additional content.

    

Low vision users who magnify their screens often see only a small part of the screen at a time (their viewport).
      This means that the additional content may not be fully visible in the current viewport and users may need to move
      their mouse over the additional content to read it. web authors should therefore ensue that additional content stays visible
      when the pointer moves away from the trigger to the (mostly adjacent) additional content. additional content should also be
      dismissible without moving the focus, so that users can read content covered by the additional content.

#### Examples
##### Content preview for links

		

When hovering over or focusing on a link, a content preview for the link appears just above or below that link.
			Users can move the pointer over the additional content (pop-up) so that they can fully read the additional content. Pressing the Esc
			key dismisses (closes) the additional content.

		

			

###### HTML of example 1

```html
<p>This is the 
   <a class="a-and-tooltip" id="parent" href="index.html">trigger
   <span id="popup" role="tooltip">And this additional text 
    gives additional context on the trigger term
   </span>
  </a>.
   Text and popup are <strong>in one link (a)</strong> element.
</p>
```

		

		

			

###### CSS of example 1

```css
[role="tooltip"] {
  display: none;
  padding: 0.5em;
  background:white;
  color: black;
  border:solid black 2px;
  width:10em;
}

.a-and-tooltip {
  position: relative;
}

[role="tooltip"] {
  position: absolute;
  left:0;
  top:1em;
}
```

		

		

			

###### JavaScript of example 1

			
```javascript
// trigger and popup inside the same link

var parent = document.getElementById("parent");

parent.onmouseover = function() {
  document.getElementById("popup").style.display = "block";
}

parent.onmouseout = function() {
  document.getElementById("popup").style.display = "none";
}

parent.onfocus = function() {
  document.getElementById("popup").style.display = "block";
}

parent.onblur = function() {
  document.getElementById("popup").style.display = "none";
}

// hide when ESC is pressed

document.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
  if ((e.keyCode || e.which) === 27)
    document.getElementById("popup").style.display = "none";
});
```

		

		

[Working example of content on hover
          or focus](../../working-examples/script-hoverable/)

#### Tests
##### Procedure

    

For additional content that appears on hover check that:

    

1. The pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing.
2. The additional content stays visible and does not automatically close after a time.
3. The content can be closed without moving the pointer way from the trigger. Either by pressing Esc, by pressing another documented keyboard shortcut, or by activating the trigger.

	

For additional content that appears on focus check that:

    

1. The additional content stays visible and does not automatically close after a time.
2. The content can be closed without moving the focus way from the trigger. Either by pressing Esc, by  pressing another other documented keyboard shortcut, or by activating the trigger.

  

  

	

##### Expected Results

	

For content that appears on hover:

    

- #1, #2 and #3 are true.

	

For content that appears on focus:

    

- #1 and #2 are true.
